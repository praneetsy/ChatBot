### Customer Requirements:
1. **Complete Update Without Special Tools**:
   - **Requirement**: A software update or a new ECU update must be possible completely without the need for special tools. Any deviations must be agreed upon with the project management of the OTA services.
   - **System Requirement**: Nexteer shall ensure that software updates or new ECU updates are possible without the application of special tools, and any deviations are agreed with VW project management of the OTA services.

2. **Programming Preconditions Before Bootloader Switch**:
   - **Requirement**: Before switching to the bootloader, suitable programming preconditions, if necessary OTA diagnostics specific, must be checked. It should be taken into account that, unlike an update in the workshop, the vehicle is in the hands of the customer.
   - **System Requirement**: Suitable programming preconditions must be checked before switching to the bootloader, considering that the vehicle is in the hands of the customer.

3. **Automatic Teach-In Routines**:
   - **Requirement**: Automatic teach-in routines after an online remote update must be individually agreed upon with the project management of the OTA services.
   - **System Requirement**: Nexteer shall ensure that automatic teach-in routines after an online remote update are agreed with VW project management of the OTA services.

4. **No Customer-Visible Effects During Initialization**:
   - **Requirement**: During the initialization phase after an online remote update, the target ECU must not perform calibrations or other measures that have customer-visible effects. Any exceptions must be agreed upon with the project management of the OTA services.
   - **System Requirement**: The system shall not perform calibrations or other measures that have customer-visible effects during the initialization phase after an online remote update. Any exceptions must be coordinated and agreed with VW.

5. **Support for Online Remote Update (ORU)**:
   - **Requirement**: The software must be designed to support ECU online remote update (ORU).
   - **System Requirement**: System software shall be designed to support ECU online remote update (ORU).

6. **Deactivation of Non-Essential Functions During OTA Diagnostics**:
   - **Requirement**: All ECUs must deactivate all vehicle functions and electrical consumers that are not required to perform the diagnostic function and communication during an ongoing OTA diagnostics in the secured vehicle condition (ORU signal == RUNNING).
   - **System Requirement**: The system shall deactivate all vehicle functions and electrical consumers not required for diagnostic function and communication during an ongoing OTA diagnostics in the secured vehicle condition (ORU signal == RUNNING).

7. **Robustness Against Safety-Critical States**:
   - **Requirement**: ECUs must be robustly developed to ensure that OTA diagnostics do not lead to safety-critical states (e.g., unwanted locking of doors).
   - **System Requirement**: Nexteer shall ensure that OTA diagnostics are free of safety-critical states.

### Actionable Items for Engineering Team:
1. **Design and Development**:
   - Ensure the software update process is seamless and does not require special tools.
   - Implement and verify programming preconditions before switching to the bootloader.
   - Develop and test automatic teach-in routines, ensuring they are agreed upon with the project management.
   - Ensure no customer-visible effects during the initialization phase post-update.
   - Design the system to support ORU capabilities.
   - Implement mechanisms to deactivate non-essential functions during OTA diagnostics.
   - Ensure the system is robust and free from safety-critical states during OTA diagnostics.

2. **Coordination and Agreement**:
   - Regularly coordinate with VW project management to agree on any deviations, exceptions, and specific requirements related to OTA updates.

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure all requirements are met, especially focusing on customer-visible effects, safety-critical states, and the robustness of the OTA update process.

By addressing these requirements and considerations, the engineering team can ensure a smooth and reliable OTA firmware update process."

1. **Iriarte Vincent 2013-05-03**: Noise grunting in SPEPS or hard to turn.
2. **Iriarte Vincent 2013-05-03**: Scratch noise when turning the handwheel to the right. Part requested by Nathalie Bonnet (PSA) for the high mileage study.
3. **Iriarte Vincent 2013-06-26**: PSA Poissy plant: Found rattle noise while evaluating a DS3 on test track on the pavements.
4. **Iriarte Vincent 2013-09-17**: Clunk noise while turning the HW CW/CCW after 30' of usage of the car.
5. **Iriarte Vincent 2013-10-08**: On a DS3 @ Poissy plant, very high clunk noise while turning the HW CW/CCW coming from the SPEPS at the first start of the vehicle. Then, when the vehicle was evaluated by Nexteer on a parking, turning the handwheel to the EOT right and coming back CCW, the system blocked with a very high friction metallic noise.

7. **User Unknown 2015-05-26**: J.P Correia 01/10/10: Noise on pavement. Part received from customer.
8. **User Unknown 2015-05-26**: Rattle noise. Seems to be similar to eroom 235 & 236. TearDown analysis shows exactly the same failure mode as item 235 & 236: Pinched rack bushing o'ring that led to bad rack rock settings. So problem solving plan & corrective actions have to be seen on item #235.
9. **User Unknown 2015-05-26**: Road tested and confirmed fault when making small movements with steering a hard spot can be felt as if the power steering motor stops working suddenly. Found all ok when making large movements. The noise sounds like the motor.

### Customer Requirements:
1. **Complete Update Without Special Tools**:
   - **Requirement**: The software update or a new ECU update must be possible completely without the need for special tools. Any deviations must be agreed upon with the project management of the OTA services.
   - **System Requirement**: Ensure that the update process does not require special tools and any deviations are coordinated with the project management.

2. **Preconditions Before Bootloader Switch**:
   - **Requirement**: Before switching to the bootloader, suitable programming preconditions, possibly specific to OTA diagnostics, must be checked. It should be considered that the vehicle is in the hands of the customer, unlike an update in the workshop.
   - **System Requirement**: Check suitable programming preconditions before switching to the bootloader, considering the vehicle is with the customer.

3. **Automatic Teach-In Routines**:
   - **Requirement**: Automatic teach-in routines after an online remote update must be individually agreed upon with the project management of the OTA services.
   - **System Requirement**: Ensure that automatic teach-in routines are agreed upon with the project management.

4. **No Customer-Visible Effects During Initialization**:
   - **Requirement**: During the initialization phase after an online remote update, the target ECU must not perform calibrations or other measures that have customer-visible effects. Any exceptions must be coordinated with the project management.
   - **System Requirement**: Avoid customer-visible effects during initialization and coordinate any exceptions with the project management.

5. **Support for Online Remote Update (ORU)**:
   - **Requirement**: The software must be designed to support ECU online remote updates (ORU).
   - **System Requirement**: Design the system software to support ORU.

6. **Deactivation of Non-Essential Functions During OTA Diagnostics**:
   - **Requirement**: All ECUs must deactivate vehicle functions and electrical consumers not required for performing the diagnostic function and communication during an ongoing OTA diagnostics in the secured vehicle condition (ORU signal == RUNNING).
   - **System Requirement**: Deactivate non-essential vehicle functions and electrical consumers during OTA diagnostics.

7. **Robustness Against Safety-Critical States**:
   - **Requirement**: The ECUs must be robustly developed to ensure that OTA diagnostics do not lead to safety-critical states (e.g., unwanted door locking).
   - **System Requirement**: Ensure that OTA diagnostics are free of safety-critical states.

### Actionable Items for Engineering Team:
1. **Design and Development**:
   - Ensure the software update process is seamless and does not require special tools.
   - Implement checks for suitable programming preconditions before switching to the bootloader.
   - Design the software to support ORU and deactivate non-essential functions during OTA diagnostics.
   - Ensure robustness against safety-critical states during OTA diagnostics.

2. **Coordination and Agreement**:
   - Coordinate with project management for any deviations, automatic teach-in routines, and exceptions that may have customer-visible effects.

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the system meets all the specified requirements, especially focusing on the robustness and safety aspects during OTA updates.

By addressing these requirements and considerations, the engineering team can ensure a smooth and reliable OTA firmware update process."

- **Yellow Risk**: This indicates a moderate level of risk. There may be some issues or concerns that need to be addressed, but they are not critical and can be managed with appropriate actions.
- **Red Risk**: This would indicate a high level of risk. There are significant issues or concerns that could impact the program's success, and immediate action is required to mitigate these risks.

In the data provided, a ""White"" risk level for both Nexteer and the customer suggests that the programs are generally on track and do not face significant challenges."

1. Identify the type of sourcing you need. This could be Model to Model (M2M) sourcing for a new Part Number for a new or existing program, Spot-buy (SB) for a one-time fixed quantity purchase, Global Sourcing (GS) for quoting existing business with alternate supplier(s), Supplier Negotiation for changes to existing contract terms, or Early Supplier Sourcing (ESS) to select a supplier prior to the award of business by the customer.

2. Use the Sourcing/Intelex Parts Management (IPM) application for part number assignment and tracking, document retention, and sourcing direction. Referred to as the 'sourcing' application, it replaces PMD for new parts.

3. Assess your supplier's status for Financial Risk Assessment, Intelex registration, NBH, Sustainability Questionnaire answer and Nexteer review completion of the Questionnaire, Quality Cert, 6 mo. Scorecard, Quality Scorecard, Terms and Conditions exceptions, and Manufacturing Capability Assessment (MCA) to understand the risk of the bid list suppliers. 

4. Use the Intelex system to take a ""snapshot"" of the bid list suppliers' profile data at each step of the sourcing process until final sourcing approval. All data is available and visible to the buyer starting from the 1st buyer stage.

5. Confirm supplier capacity/pricing. If the Intelex RFQ app was not used then the following must be saved to the IPM record: a) Quote confirmation from the supplier b) The communication the buyer sent to the supplier requesting the information.

6. Depending on the sourcing type, a purchase order may need to be issued as part of the process. For example, in ESS sourcing, purchase orders are not issued and require a separate commercial action within Intelex.

Note: This is a general guideline and specific processes might vary depending on the exact nature of your sourcing needs. Always refer to Nexteer's procedures and guidelines for the most accurate information."

It is one of the key milestones in the Customer Program Implementation (CPI) process at Nexteer Automotive. Enterprise Reviews are meetings held to review program details at the end of each CPI phase. These meetings are planned by the program manager and attended by a review board of top management. The agenda typically includes:

- A review of incomplete process step outputs and mitigation plans to close gaps.
- A review of identified risks and associated mitigation plans.
- The status of customer and Nexteer milestones and metrics.
- A determination of whether the team can proceed to the next phase of CPI or if a stop-and-fix situation is required before moving on in the process.

ER3 specifically would be the third such review in the sequence of Enterprise Reviews, corresponding to the third phase of the CPI process."

\[
\text{Average Duration} = \frac{1113 + 1064 + 904 + 994 + 935 + 960 + 2667 + 2926 + 1841 + 888}{10} = \frac{14292}{10} = 1429.2 \text{ days}

Based on the average duration of similar programs (1429 days), we can estimate the expected start of production date as follows:

\[
\text{Expected Start of Production Date} = \text{Signed Charter Date} + \text{Average Duration}
\]

\[
\text{Expected Start of Production Date} = \text{August 10, 2021} + 1429 \text{ days}
\]

Adding 1429 days to August 10, 2021, we get:

\[
\text{Expected Start of Production Date} = \text{July 3, 2025}
\]

So, we can expect the Polaris program to go into production around July 3, 2025."

### Customer Requirement:
**Prevent steering lock in a high speed drive**

### System Requirements:
1. **High-Speed Detection:**
   - The system shall detect when the vehicle is driving at high speed using the vehicle speed sensor.
   - The threshold for high speed shall be configurable and defined based on safety standards and customer specifications.

2. **Steering Lock Prevention:**
   - The system shall disable any function that could lead to steering lock when the vehicle is detected to be in a high-speed state.
   - The system shall ensure that the steering column remains in an adjustable state and does not enter a locked state during high-speed driving.

3. **Fail-Safe Mechanism:**
   - The system shall implement a fail-safe mechanism to ensure that in the event of a system failure, the steering lock is prevented during high-speed driving.

### Software Requirements:
1. **High-Speed Detection Algorithm:**
   - The software shall implement an algorithm to continuously monitor the vehicle speed and determine if the vehicle is in a high-speed state.
   - The software shall use the vehicle speed sensor input to determine the current speed.

2. **Steering Lock Control:**
   - The software shall disable the steering lock function when the vehicle is detected to be in a high-speed state.
   - The software shall ensure that the steering column adjustment remains enabled during high-speed driving.

3. **Configuration Parameters:**
   - The software shall allow configuration of the high-speed threshold value.
   - The software shall provide an interface for updating the high-speed threshold value based on customer requirements.

4. **Error Handling and Diagnostics:**
   - The software shall log any errors related to the high-speed detection and steering lock control.
   - The software shall provide diagnostic information to assist in troubleshooting any issues related to the steering lock prevention mechanism.

### Software Design Considerations:
1. **Real-Time Processing:**
   - The software must be capable of real-time processing to ensure timely detection of high-speed states and immediate response to prevent steering lock.

2. **Redundancy:**
   - Implement redundancy in the high-speed detection mechanism to ensure reliability and safety.

3. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Thorough testing and validation must be conducted to ensure that the steering lock prevention mechanism works correctly under all high-speed driving conditions.

### Potential Challenges:
1. **Accurate Speed Detection:**
   - Ensuring accurate and reliable detection of vehicle speed to prevent false positives or negatives in high-speed detection.

2. **System Integration:**
   - Integrating the steering lock prevention mechanism with existing vehicle systems without causing conflicts or unintended behavior.

3. **Safety Compliance:**
   - Ensuring that the system complies with all relevant safety standards and regulations.

By addressing these requirements and considerations, the engineering team can effectively design and implement a solution to prevent steering lock during high-speed driving, ensuring safety and reliability for the end users."

#### CPI Process Overview:
- The Program Manager, with the support of PDT members and Functional Leads, uses the CPI framework to understand key deliverables and dependencies. This is important to assess gaps and develop a response strategy to address them.
- Not every deliverable may be required for a program; therefore, all deliverables should be assessed for necessity. This should be a collaborative activity between the program's PDT members, Functional Leads, and Program Manager.

#### Key Deliverables Spotlight:
- **BOM Risk Assessment:**
  - The first major activity for the PDT after charter. The purpose is to level up the entire team by reviewing the design level at charter and understanding program financials and assumptions.

- **Launch Plan for Every Part (LPFEP):**
  - Defines a process to develop timing plans for every part in a program. It helps the PDT be more effective with detailed timeline planning. The LPFEP is baselined and serves as the ""Plan of Record"" as an input for ME, GSM, and PE to enter the Program Data and Due Dates into MEED, Intelex, and PE Tracker. This input enables each function to monitor their project plans.

- **Program Planning/Timeline:**
  - After the BOM RA is complete, all step outputs are reviewed by the PDT to determine if the outputs are required or not required.

1. **Wheel Speed Sensors**: These sensors are typically mounted on each wheel and measure the rotational speed of the wheels. The data from these sensors is used to calculate the vehicle's speed.

2. **Transmission Speed Sensors**: These sensors measure the rotational speed of the transmission. This data can be used to determine the vehicle's speed, especially in automatic transmission systems.

3. **GPS**: Some modern vehicles use GPS data to calculate speed. This method is often used in conjunction with other sensors to provide more accurate speed readings.

4. **CAN Bus**: The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus in a vehicle can transmit speed data from various sensors to the vehicle's electronic control units (ECUs). The CAN bus allows different parts of the vehicle to communicate with each other.

5. **Radar and Lidar**: Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) may use radar and lidar to measure the speed of the vehicle relative to other objects and vehicles on the road.

Each of these methods has its own advantages and is used in different contexts within the vehicle's overall system to ensure accurate speed measurement."

In the requirement, we're focused on making sure the system can handle short circuits involving the supply lines to both Ubat, which is the battery voltage, and GND, or ground. What we're doing here is not about directly shorting Ubat to GND, nor is it about shorting another voltage line, like V_filr_switched_battery, to Ubat and GND. Instead, we're testing each power output’s capability to resist shorts to Ubat and GND separately. We use an external fuse in a controlled setup to ensure the system maintains its stability and safety under these short circuit conditions.",

   - Formal Customer Complaint
   - Major Disruption
   - Product Safety and Compliance issues

2. **Measurements of Effectiveness and Efficiency**:
   - Completion rate of 3L5Y (3 Levels of 5 Whys) within the defined time window.
   - Verification of Corrective Action Effectiveness within the defined time window.

However, based on the context of Nexteer's corrective action process, ""3L5Y"" refers to a problem-solving methodology that involves asking ""Why?"" five times at three different levels to identify the root cause of an issue. This technique is commonly used in quality management and continuous improvement processes to ensure that the underlying cause of a problem is addressed, rather than just treating the symptoms.

1. **Training and Competency Development**:
   - Various training tools are available to help users develop their competency in creating a corrective action plan using the 3L5Y approach.
   - Training can be accessed through the Compass Quality Web Site under Quality/Training & Education/""3L5Y - eQMS"" section.
   - A blank 3L5Y file can be accessed through the Business Systems Documentation Site under Instructions/Forms (Type 15-1-5-F6).
   - Additional training is available on Success Factor, Learning by searching for ""3L5Y training level 2"".

2. **Corrective Action Life Cycle**:
   - All FCCs (Field Concern Cases) must have a 3L5Y (or equivalent for electronic suppliers) completed through Root Cause and Corrective Action plan within 60 days of complaint issuance.
   - Major disruption and PSCC (Pre-Start Control Chart) 3L5Y must be completed as soon as possible.
   - For Nexteer manufacturing caused issues, the Web App embedded 3L5Y must be used.
   - For supplier manufacturing caused issues, the Intelex - PCMS (Problem Case Management System) must be used.

3. **Process Flow for Prelaunch Formal/Informal Corrective Actions**:
   - The goal is to close all Prelaunch Formal/Informal Corrective Actions before Customer PPAP (Production Part Approval Process) and SOP (Start of Production).
   - For Nexteer manufactured issues, it is acceptable to use customer/internal designated problem-solving methodologies and documentation instead of a 3L5Y.

4. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Corrective Actions must be created in the eQMS System - Corrective Action Module.
   - If the root cause cannot be determined using available problem-solving methodologies, the 3L5Y owner must contact the Corporate Quality Management System manager for further steps.

#### Purpose
This procedure describes the human organization for production specifications. It applies to all Nexteer plants to ensure they meet HOP (Human Organization for Production) requirements.

#### Scope
This procedure applies to Nexteer sites globally.

#### Acronyms
- **HOP**: Human Organization for Production
- **VS**: Value Stream
- **APL**: Autonomous Production Leader
- **PSP**: Plant Strategic Plan
- **DLE**: Direct Labor Efficiency
- **DLP**: Direct Labor Productivity
- **SQDIC**: Safety, Quality, Delivery, Inventory, Cost

#### HOP Definition
HOP describes the manufacturing organization to be set up in each plant. The purpose is to transfer decision-making and expertise to the level of the organization where the action needs to take place. It also acts as a basis for recruitment, training, and role development at all levels. HOP is a tool that allocates responsibilities to the right level to achieve autonomy and accountability in the production area. It defines how to develop the plant human organization to support production in the most efficient way.

#### Manufacturing Structure
The standard Nexteer manufacturing plant has the following organization, based on 5 levels:
1. **Level 1**: Operators or any other employees in the team
2. **Level 2**: Team Leaders
   - Optimal team size is 8-12 people.
   - Team leaders may or may not supervise operators.
   - Production Team leaders are direct hourly labor if they have an operator role.
3. **Level 3**: Supervisors (production supervisors and warehouse supervisors)
   - Optimal managing 6-8 teams.
4. **Level 4**: Department Managers (Production, PC&L, ME, Quality, NPS, etc.)
   - Maximum 350 people (Optimal 250 people).
   - Can be replaced by a supervisor in a small plant.
5. **Level 5**: Plant Manager (General Manager is at the same level in manufacturing management).

#### Key Points
- Levels 1, 2, and 3 are shift-based.
- Levels 1 and 2 are in the same job category.
- Smaller plants may not have both supervisors and managers; sometimes only supervisors who directly report to the plant manager.

#### HOP Objectives
- A clearly defined and effective manufacturing structure, current and target.
- A more efficient decision-making, problem detection/elimination process in autonomous production areas.
- People development.

It is the plant manager's responsibility to define the content and timing in its concrete application to the principles. The basic principle is to transfer decision-making and expertise to the action level.

Here is a detailed overview:

### Creating a Corrective Action

1. **Initiation**:
   - The Lead APQP or their designate initiates the Corrective Action (CA) for both prelaunch formal and informal issues, applicable to both make and purchase parts.
   - For purchase parts, a Problem Case (PC) is initiated in Intelex PCMS.

2. **Documentation**:
   - The responsible party completes the 3L5Y in the eQMS system.
   - If the issue involves a supplier, the Functional Lead (GSM AQE/GSM SQE) updates the specification/system cause to SCM_SCM or SCM_N to N and enters the PC case number. They then create an individual CA in the 3L5Y section of the CA module in eQMS, referencing the PCMS number.

3. **Supplier Involvement**:
   - The Functional Lead leads the 3L5Y process in Intelex PCMS 3.0 with the supplier.

### Closing a Corrective Action

1. **Verification**:
   - After the PC case is completed in Intelex, the individual CA action referencing the PC number is closed in eQMS.
   - The Lead APQP verifies the closure and approval in eQMS.

2. **Post-PPAP Approval**:
   - Before saleable PPAP approval for supplier manufacturing issues, the AQE/SQE verifies the implementation and effectiveness of the corrective action.
   - After saleable PPAP approval, the Plant Quality Manager and their department are responsible for verifying the implementation and effectiveness of the corrective action. This includes ensuring that the actions taken were effective in eliminating the issue.

3. **Documentation and Monitoring**:
   - Verification activities must be documented, including the record of verification for PSCC and FCC.
   - It is recommended to include evidence in the General Attachments section that the individual CAs are indeed implemented and effective.

4. **Deviation Closure**:
   - Deviations should be closed immediately after all corrective actions have been completed. The corrective action owner is responsible for ensuring the closure of the deviation and must include the reason for closure.
   - If another person is closing the deviation, they must contact the corrective action owner before closing it.

### Additional Notes

- For ongoing rework activities that deviate from the PPAP approved manufacturing process, an approved Engineering Change Request (ECR) is required instead of a Deviation.
- All software-related re-flash deviations are automatically designated as severity level 10, requiring approvals from the Chief ME/Eng. Director, Quality APQP Manager, and Director of Electronics Systems & Software.

This process ensures that corrective actions are systematically managed, verified, and documented to maintain quality and compliance standards."

### Steps for Corrective Action:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - Clearly describe the problem. This is the first phase where the issue is identified and documented.

2. **Containment Plan Determination**:
   - Develop a containment plan to prevent the problem from affecting more products or processes. This is also part of the first phase.

3. **Root Cause Determination**:
   - Use problem-solving tools such as the 5-Why analysis or fishbone diagrams to identify the root cause of the problem. This is a critical step to ensure that the corrective action addresses the actual cause of the issue.

4. **Corrective Action Determination**:
   - Determine the specific corrective actions needed to address the root cause. Document what actions will be taken, who is responsible for each action, and the timeline for implementation.

5. **Verification of Corrective Action Implementation and Problem Elimination**:
   - Verify that the corrective actions have been implemented as planned and that they are effective in eliminating the problem. The team should agree on the length of time the corrective actions will be monitored prior to verification.

6. **Preventive Action**:
   - Address preventive actions to avoid recurrence of the problem. Examples include error-proofing processes, design or process changes, procedural changes, and updated or new training requirements.

### Documentation and Records:
- Ensure all steps and actions are well-documented. Use forms such as the Nexteer Problem Solving Form or equivalent.
- Maintain records as per the Record Management procedure.

### References:
- **Nexteer Problem Solving Form** or equivalent
- **3 Legged 5 Why (3L5W)**

It is a formal authorization that allows customers to return defective or unwanted products to the manufacturer or supplier for repair, replacement, or refund. The RMA process ensures that returns are handled efficiently and that the returned products are tracked and managed properly.

In the context of Nexteer Automotive, an RMA might be used to handle returns of automotive parts that are found to be defective or not meeting the required specifications. The process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Request for RMA:** The customer contacts the supplier or manufacturer to request an RMA for the return of a product.
2. **Issuance of RMA Number:** The supplier or manufacturer issues an RMA number, which is used to track the return.
3. **Return of Product:** The customer returns the product, including the RMA number with the shipment.
4. **Inspection and Processing:** The returned product is inspected to determine the cause of the issue and the appropriate action (repair, replacement, or refund).
5. **Resolution:** The supplier or manufacturer takes the necessary action to resolve the issue and communicates the resolution to the customer.

The RMA process helps ensure that returns are handled systematically and that both the customer and the supplier have a clear record of the return and its resolution."

### Audit Details:
- **Audit ID**: 291807
- **Area**: All Areas
- **Process**: 2024 Corporate QMS Audit-P77&79
- **Auditor**: Rohn, Troy
- **Created**: 2024-03-27
- **Finding Type**: Minor Finding
- **Finding Assigned to**: Rohn, Troy
- **Finding**: PL2405

### Key Findings:
1. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - The process of Plant 77 performance evaluation isn't entirely effective.
   - The CofA (Corrective Action) process metrics for 'Open to close' have not met the target for several months and have been trending in the wrong direction since Q4 2023.
   - Although the CofA metrics are reviewed weekly with Plant Management, no actions have been effective in reversing the trend.
   - After the audit of this process, the week 16 data shows a dramatic improvement.

2. **Unofficial KPI Monitoring**:
   - An unofficial KPI is being monitored as part of CofA 3.0, which includes tracking timing from reject to disassembly to a target of 24 hours.
   - Results for BMW FAAR WE show 286 High Priority cases >24 hours, while K0 has 412 High Priority cases >24 hours.

3. **N2N (Nexteer to Nexteer) Issues**:
   - Another metric with poor performance is the number of open problem cases issued between Nexteer Plants (N2N) but unresolved.
   - As the supplier Plant, for 2023, Plant 77 has 17 N2N past due problem cases, with the oldest being 414 days overdue.

### Root Causes:
- **Why1 for Occur**:
  - CofA process metrics don't meet the target.
  - N2N issues between Nexteer Plants are out of target.
- **Why2 for Occur**:
  - Open actions are not being closed on time.
  - N2N issues are not properly handled.
- **Why3 for Occur**:
  - The escalation process for repeated issues in Actis is not effective.
  - No person responsible for N2N.
- **Why4 for Occur**:
  - Large quantity of actions generated in the Actis system—every single case is a separate issue.
  - In 2020, the CQE role responsible for N2N was canceled.
- **Why5 for Occur**:
  - N2N activities were transferred to Plant QE as an additional action.

### Containment Actions:
- **For Occur**:
  - Modernization of the Actis system with a failure mode module to group main problems in the production line and update with the possibility of prioritization of Actis issues (2 new modules in Actis system).

It is a term used within the CPI (Customer Program Implementation) process to refer to the financial and operational aspects of a customer program. Here are some key points about PRG:

1. **Financial Reviews**: The Program Manager is responsible for performing financial reviews to determine if the PRG/AR (Program/Annual Revenue) financial commitments are being met at various Enterprise Reviews (ER) stages from ER-2 through ER-6.

2. **Enterprise Review Business Case**: This includes coordinating total build cost requests to capture changes and document associated costs. All functions should document actual costs when available at ER-5 and ER-6, including material costs, logistics and packaging costs, CapEx spending by calendar year, additional forecast spending, launch start-up costs, temporary workers, engineering, warranty, and rebill payments.

3. **PRG Disposition**: This involves the sales board and sales review board for commercial agreements and notifications.

4. **Change Control**: PRG involves managing changes through Engineering Change Requests (ECRs) and ensuring that changes are approved by the appropriate boards and managers.

5. **Pricing Strategy**: Developing pricing strategies with sales and the Product Development Team (PDT) for customer changes to maintain or improve PRG/AR financials.

6. **Risk Management**: The Program Manager is responsible for addressing overall program risk that may result from changes, referencing the CPI Risk & Issue Management Operating Instructions.

In summary, PRG is a comprehensive term that encompasses the financial, operational, and risk management aspects of a customer program within the CPI process."

Here's a detailed look at how material costs are managed and confirmed through the different phases:

### Phases and Material Cost Variability

1. **Phase 1: Develop Product Process and PDT Plans**
   - **Material Cost Variability**: High
   - **Activities**: Initial Bill of Materials (BOM) risk assessment, preliminary material cost estimates, and supplier identification.
   - **Status**: Material costs are based on initial estimates and assumptions. There is significant uncertainty and variability at this stage.

2. **Phase 2: Validate Product Designs for Production**
   - **Material Cost Variability**: Moderate to High
   - **Activities**: Detailed design work, refinement of BOM, and initial supplier quotes.
   - **Status**: Material costs become more defined as designs are validated and initial supplier quotes are obtained. However, there is still considerable variability as designs may change.

3. **Phase 3: Validate Manufacturing System**
   - **Material Cost Variability**: Moderate
   - **Activities**: Finalization of manufacturing system design, detailed supplier negotiations, and validation of material costs.
   - **Status**: Material costs are more accurately defined as the manufacturing system is validated and supplier negotiations are completed. Variability decreases but some uncertainty remains.

4. **Phase 4: Produce Products and Services**
   - **Material Cost Variability**: Low to Moderate
   - **Activities**: Production ramp-up, final supplier agreements, and material cost tracking.
   - **Status**: Material costs are largely confirmed as production begins and final supplier agreements are in place. Variability is low, but there may still be some adjustments based on production realities.

5. **Phase 5: Continuous Improvement**
   - **Material Cost Variability**: Low
   - **Activities**: Ongoing production, continuous improvement initiatives, and cost optimization.
   - **Status**: Material costs are stable and well-understood. Continuous improvement efforts may lead to further cost reductions, but variability is minimal.

6. **Phase 6: Continuous Improvement Complete**
   - **Material Cost Variability**: Minimal
   - **Activities**: Final production, program closure, and final cost assessment.
   - **Status**: Material costs are fully confirmed and documented. Variability is minimal as the program is closed and final costs are assessed.

### Confirmation of Material Costs

- **Material costs are typically confirmed in Phase 3 (Validate Manufacturing System)**. By this phase, the manufacturing system design is finalized, detailed supplier negotiations are completed, and material costs are validated. This phase marks the point where material costs become more accurately defined and less variable.

### Summary

- **High Variability**: Phases 1 and 2, where material costs are based on initial estimates and designs are still being validated.
- **Moderate Variability**: Phase 3, where material costs are more accurately defined through supplier negotiations and manufacturing system validation.
- **Low Variability**: Phases 4 and 5, where material costs are largely confirmed and stable, with ongoing production and continuous improvement efforts.
- **Minimal Variability**: Phase 6, where material costs are fully confirmed and documented as the program is closed.

By Phase 3, material costs are largely confirmed, reducing the variability and providing a more accurate financial picture for the program."

This phase occurs before the official start of the CPI process and involves initial research, feasibility studies, and early-stage planning. Here’s how the AR phase fits into the overall CPI framework:

### AR Phase (Phase 0): Advanced Research
- **Purpose**: To conduct initial research and feasibility studies to determine the viability of a potential program.
- **Activities**:
  - **Market Research**: Analyzing market trends, customer needs, and competitive landscape.
  - **Feasibility Studies**: Assessing the technical and financial feasibility of the proposed program.
  - **Concept Development**: Developing initial product concepts and high-level designs.
  - **Preliminary Cost Estimates**: Estimating initial costs, including material, labor, and development costs.
  - **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential risks and developing preliminary mitigation strategies.
  - **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engaging with key stakeholders to gather input and secure initial buy-in.

### Integration with CPI Phases
- **Transition to CPI Phase 1**: The AR phase sets the foundation for the CPI process. Once the feasibility and initial planning are completed, the program can transition to Phase 1 of CPI, where detailed planning and development begin.
- **Documentation**: The findings and outputs from the AR phase are documented and used as inputs for the subsequent CPI phases. This includes market research reports, feasibility study results, initial cost estimates, and risk assessments.

### Summary
- **AR Phase (Phase 0)**: A preliminary phase focused on advanced research, feasibility studies, and early-stage planning. It helps determine the viability of a potential program and sets the stage for the CPI process.
- **CPI Phase 1**: The official start of the CPI process, where detailed planning and development activities begin based on the findings from the AR phase.

By treating the AR phase as ""Phase 0,"" you can ensure a structured approach to program development, starting with thorough research and feasibility assessments before moving into the detailed planning and execution phases of CPI."

However, the idea of having a preliminary phase before the official start of a structured process like CPI is a common practice in project management and product development methodologies. This preliminary phase is often referred to as ""Phase 0"" or ""Pre-Phase"" and typically involves activities such as feasibility studies, initial research, and early-stage planning.

In the context of CPI, it makes logical sense to have an initial phase where foundational activities are conducted to ensure the viability and readiness of a program before it officially enters the structured CPI phases. This approach helps in mitigating risks early and setting a solid foundation for the subsequent phases.

If you need specific references or more detailed information about the AR phase within the CPI framework, I can search the CPI knowledgebase for any relevant documents or guidelines that might provide further insights. Would you like me to do that?"

In the context of CPI (Customer Program Implementation), AR typically stands for ""Appropriation Request."" This is a formal request for funding and resources needed to support a program or project. The AR phase can be considered a preliminary step before the official CPI phases begin, where the necessary financial and resource approvals are obtained.

### Appropriation Request (AR) Phase
- **Purpose**: To secure the necessary funding and resources required for the program.
- **Activities**:
  - **Budget Planning**: Developing a detailed budget that outlines the financial requirements for the program.
  - **Resource Allocation**: Identifying and planning for the resources needed, including personnel, equipment, and materials.
  - **Financial Justification**: Providing a detailed financial justification for the requested funds, including cost-benefit analysis and return on investment (ROI) calculations.
  - **Approval Process**: Submitting the appropriation request to the relevant stakeholders and decision-makers for approval.
  - **Documentation**: Preparing and submitting all necessary documentation to support the appropriation request, including project plans, risk assessments, and financial projections.

### Integration with CPI Phases
- **Transition to CPI Phase 1**: Once the appropriation request is approved, the program can transition to Phase 1 of CPI, where detailed planning and development activities begin.
- **Documentation**: The approved appropriation request and associated documentation are used as inputs for the subsequent CPI phases, ensuring that the program has the necessary funding and resources to proceed.

### Summary
- **AR Phase (Appropriation Request)**: A preliminary phase focused on securing the necessary funding and resources for the program. It involves budget planning, resource allocation, financial justification, and an approval process.
- **CPI Phase 1**: The official start of the CPI process, where detailed planning and development activities begin based on the approved appropriation request.

By treating the AR phase as a preliminary step, you can ensure that the program has the necessary financial and resource backing before moving into the structured CPI phases. This helps in mitigating financial risks and ensuring that the program is well-prepared to proceed."

### Phase 1 Lessons Learned Workshop (Required for Category 1 & 2 Programs)
- **Goal**: Review similar programs and capture any Lessons Learned to improve the launch and prevent repeat mistakes.
- **Review**: The ER-6 pBI database from past program Lessons Learned with the PDT (Program Development Team) and determine which ones should be added into the new CPI (Continuous Process Improvement) program for follow-up.
- **Collect Information**: From a reference program selected by the PDT, collect the following additional information for potential Lessons Learned:
  - Top warranty issues for the past 2 years
  - Top 5 Plant RTY (Right-First-Time Yield) issues for the past year
  - Supplier performance issues
  - Recent MFA (Manufacturing Alerts) issues
  - Best Practices
  - Voice of the Customer
  - Prototype Center issues

### ER-6 Lessons Learned Workshop
- **Thought Starters**: Remember to document what went well also.
  - **PE (Product Engineering)**: Drawings not released on time, Failures in DV (Design Validation) or PV (Product Validation) - either design or test.
  - **ESSE (Electrical Systems and Software Engineering)**: Drawings/Software not released on time, Failures in DV or PV - either design or test.
  - **ME (Manufacturing Engineering)**: MQ1, MQ2 runoffs late or insufficient per procedures.
  - **Best Practices**
  - **MFA's (Manufacturing Alerts) Issued**
  - **GSM (Global Supply Management)**: Suppliers not sourced on time, Supplier PPAP (Production Part Approval Process) approvals late.
  - **Commercial and Financial**: Customer scorecard feedback, Tooling PO (Purchase Order) late - communications made?
  - **Quality**: Causes of customer complaints.
  - **Operations**: Launch scorecard misses.
  - **PCL (Product Cost Leadership)**: Dunnage design late.
  - **Finance**: Missed Financial targets.
  - **PM (Program Management)**: Timing misses.
  - **Other**: Were the burden rate assumptions on target, systemic improvements made by the CPI swim lane owner.

### Documentation and Follow-Up
- **APQP (Advanced Product Quality Planning)** updates the Master ER6 Lessons Learned database accordingly with the new LL (Lessons Learned) from this program. Be sure to document if the issue was a Systemic or Customer impacted item.
- **Review**: Either in the normal PDT meeting or a separate LL workshop meeting with key PDT members, review all the Program Learnings, Lessons Learned, and Best Practices accumulated since ER1 that are documented in CPI Risk Section ""CPI Program Learnings & Best Practices (Phases 2 - 6)"".
- **Document**: Any new Learnings, Lessons Learned, and Best Practices that were shared during the workshop into the same CPI Risk Section as above. Strive to get LL from each of the functional groups represented in the PDT.
- **Identify Systemic Issues**: Identify if any are systemic related and cannot be closed by the PDT or the receiving Continuous Improvement Team. Assign an action for the applicable functional lead to follow up with the appropriate person outside CPI.
  - **Example**: Use keyword ""SYSTEMIC"": Cory Ricker to review systemic learning with CPI Council Karen Cole"" Due Date: 11/14/2022.
- **Highlight Customer Impacted Issues**: Identify the top customer impacted and highlight in CPI Risk Section.

### Additional Information
- **Lessons Learned Information**: Includes but is not limited to PSCC/FCC 3L5Ys, validation program lessons learned lists, Warranty phases, issues, etc.
- **Control**: Lessons learned source rollout and communication plan for electronic and manual sources.
- **Electronic Sources**: Use automated triggers to create draft corrective actions in eQMS. Manual sources to use lessonslearned@nexteer.com.
- **Lessons Learned Coordinator**: Draft eQMS ""Corrective Action"".
- **Initial Assessment**: Determine if information is a lessons learned. If deemed not a Lessons Learned, Regional Coordinator contacts the CA Owner and the CA Approver(s).
- **Risk**: Lessons Learned is not assessed correctly. Control: Lessons Learned Coordinator Consults APQP Engineer with appropriate product line experience.

2. **Verification of Corrective Action Implementation and Effectiveness**:
   - For Nexteer manufacturing caused issues, the Web App CA module must be used to track completion of implementation and verification of effectiveness.
   - For Supplier manufacturing caused issues, the Intelex PCMS (Problem Case Management System) must be used to track completion of implementation and verification of effectiveness.

3. **Responsible Parties**:
   - Before saleable PPAP approval for Supplier Manufacturing issue related to both Prelaunch Formal/Informal, the AQE/SQE is responsible for verifying corrective action implementation and effectiveness.
   - Once the complaint is closed in Intelex PCMS, the Lead APQP must close the CA in eQMS.

A major disruption is a Nexteer or Nexteer supplier-caused event that interrupts the normal production flow at the customer. Here is the detailed process for handling major disruptions:

#### Definition of Major Disruption
An event is considered a major disruption if it meets any of the following criteria, even if it was not classified as ""Major Disruption"" by the customer:
- Customer yard hold that requires rework of products already assembled in the vehicle (more than one location for the same issue is considered just one major disruption).
- Field Action: An OEM notification involving action on vehicles in the field/at dealerships.
- If more than one CA type for a given issue (e.g., 0km and Warranty), the major disruption will be identified as 0km Formal CA.

#### Impact to Nexteer Metrics
- Every major disruption, independent of CA type, will be included in the Major Disruption tab of the Strategic Quality Metrics.
- A 0km Customer Complaint, whether formal or informal, should be identified as 0km Formal and as a major disruption in the eQMS.

#### Notification and Response
- Notification of a major civil disturbance affecting Nexteer Automotive may be received by the local police department, the media, Nexteer Automotive Corporate, or by employees arriving at the work site.
- Employees and visitors will be given instructions via the public address system or other methods as directed by the Emergency Response Coordinator.
- Upon receiving notification of such a disturbance, the Emergency Response Coordinator will assess the situation and determine what actions are needed to protect personnel. The type of protective actions taken will depend upon several factors including the size, type, and location of the disturbance.

#### Business Recovery Process
- **Objective:** Recover from a disaster in a manner to protect shipments to customers.
- **Scenarios:** 
  - Unable to produce required quantities of parts for a month or more.
  - In-Plant: Large plant layoffs, extra material and people costs incurred, lost profit, major financial impact.
  - Vehicle Assembly: Shutdown, huge issue, and lost profit.
  - End User: Cannot get new vehicle or service parts, moderate disruption, lower stock.

#### Actions
- Contact the local power supply company to get the information necessary to work out a contingency plan to supply power to the facility in case of a disaster.
- Determine if a disaster assessment is needed.

#### Database Information
The database contains a table named `eqms_business_systems_docs` which includes records related to business system documentation, including corrective actions.

#### Knowledge Base Information
From the knowledge base, here are some key points about corrective actions:

1. **Corrective Action Plan (CAP)**
   - The affected site must complete a corrective action plan using the Nexteer Problem Solving Summary Form or equivalent.
   - The CAP must be sent to Legal Staff and Global Environmental Management as soon as practical to allow enough time for them to comment on the proposed CAP before a response is due to the government agency.
   - If the problems cited in the Notice of Violation (NOV) can be resolved immediately and the site submits evidence of completion with the NOV, then a CAP is not required.

2. **Process Flow Changes**
   - Changes in the process flow include updating the terminology from ""Record Corrective Action"" to ""Record Response"" to accurately describe the process.
   - The system requires a response, making a decision step unnecessary.

3. **Roles and Responsibilities**
   - **Global Quality Systems & Product Safety and Compliance Head**: Facilitates effective development, implementation, and communication of corrective actions for quality and manufacturing issues.

Quality alerts are a crucial part of the corrective action process at Nexteer Automotive. Here is a summary of the key points related to quality alerts:

1. **Issuance of Quality Alerts**:
   - A Quality Alert is issued by the Quality department as a temporary action when there is a need for special communication or document containment actions.
   - Each Quality Alert must have an expiration date, tracking number, and tracking number log (either paper or electronic) to ensure they are removed upon expiration.

2. **Process Changes**:
   - If the Quality Alert includes any change of process differing from the approved control plan, a deviation must be issued and approved following the procedure 06-1-4-2 (G1302).

3. **Reaction Plans and Escalation**:
   - The organization must initiate a reaction plan indicated on the control plan and evaluate its impact on compliance to specifications for characteristics that are either not statistically capable or are unstable.
   - Reaction plans should include containment of the product and 100% inspection, as appropriate.
   - A corrective action plan must be developed and implemented, indicating specific actions, timing, and assigned responsibilities to ensure the process becomes stable and statistically capable.
   - The plans should be reviewed with and approved by the customer when required.
   - An escalation process must be locally defined to notify appropriate levels when acceptance criteria are not met, including any triggered alarm limits.

4. **Alarm Limits**:
   - Alarm limits provide a pre-determined count of discrepant events to trigger an investigation.
   - They are established based on best practices and customer-specific requirements as applicable.
   - Initially, they should be established based on FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) and DSS (Decision Support System) control and traceability strategy.

5. **Verification of Corrective Action Effectiveness**:
   - Verification of the effectiveness of corrective actions must be conducted within a defined time window.

6. **Containment Plans**:
   - If containment is required, a containment plan, including instructions, must be documented.
   - The containment plan should include specific actions to be taken and details such as where, when, and who is responsible for associated tasks.
   - The plan should also include visual displays of conforming vs. non-conforming products.

5. **Data Collection and Storage**: Traceability consists of part tracking and the collection of part process data completed at the machine level within manufacturing. This includes the process of collecting and storing key test and process data within a central database.

6. **Types of Traceability**: 
   - Singular / Serialization: Used to identify a single part or component.
   - Lot Control: Used to characterize a group of parts to a specific count as determined by the size of the lot.

7. **Data Audits**: During regular production within Nexteer facilities, data audits must verify the data is stored and the data is valid. If a discrepancy is discovered, Manufacturing Operations must define the scope of the discrepancy and report findings to Plant Quality Management.

8. **Container Label Requirements**: In conjunction with the Nexteer receiving plant's Container Label Requirement Standards, specific items must be required on all point-of-use container labels for all parts shipped into Nexteer's plants.

9. **Identification and Traceability**: Nexteer product traceability requirements apply to critical components for all 2013 model year programs and beyond. Traceability as defined by Nexteer is the ability of a supplier or sub-suppliers to provide in-process inspection data, quantity of parts produced, number of non-conforming parts, CQI required documentations, material certs, etc.

### Example:
If you are experiencing noise issues with a specific component, such as a steering system, you can follow the above steps to identify and address the problem. For instance, if the noise is occurring during steering maneuvers, you might find that a particular bearing is worn out or that there is insufficient lubrication.

### Next Steps:
If you need detailed reports or specific data on noise-related issues, I can help you retrieve relevant 3L5Y reports or other documentation from the Nexteer Automotive database. Please provide more details about the noise problem, such as the affected component, conditions under which the noise occurs, and any previous attempts to address it.

We are migrating to Microsoft Entra to take advantage of the following benefits:
• Enhanced security with a more holistic risk approach
• Synergies with other Microsoft products in our E5 license
• Significant savings since our current licensing includes Microsoft’s Identity and
Access Management (IAM) framework
2. What will be different for me after the August 1st cutover to Entra?
Please review the Okta → Entra Differences document for a reference as to changes you
can expect.
3. Is my password going to change?
No, your password to your Nexteer domain account will not change as part of this
migration.
4. Is it required for me to install Microsoft Authenticator on my mobile device?
Yes, the current policies require Microsoft Authenticator as the primary method for multifactor
authentication (MFA). If you only register for other MFA methods, you will be
prompted later to install it.
If you do not have a mobile device that supports installing Microsoft Authenticator, please
contact the Nexteer IT Security team at security@nexteer.com.",

Developers, both Function Administrators and Normal Users, can create API for RESTful and OData endpoints. The Master Data Service Function Admin can see all users API keys (these are encrypted), but only the key's owner can delete or copy the real key value [MasterDataService - Nexteer EA Technical Knowledge-merged-0.pdf].

An example of how to use the API was provided in the same document. For instance, to make a request to the OData endpoint, you need to add an api-key or access token in the header of your request. Here is an example:

```
var client = new RestClient(""https://nxt-mfgmds-dev-na-wa.azurewebsites.net/odata/TcmEntities?$filter=Type eq 'Site'"");
client.Timeout = -1;
var request = new RestRequest(Method.GET);
request.AddHeader(""api-key"", ""fake-token- >>>>>>>>>r4pQACAmffWHPzXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXJGynTc7If2mjdpAGsRNO2E9VyFQ"");
IRestResponse response = client.Execute(request);
Console.WriteLine(response.Content);
```

This is an example only, and you should replace the ""fake-token"" with your actual api-key [MasterDataService - Nexteer EA Technical Knowledge-merged-0.pdf]."

### Detailed Content from Documents

1. **Corrective Action, Lessons Learned & Look Across**
   - **Lessons Learned and Look Across**: The process ensures that corrective actions taken are shared for similar products and processes where applicable. A 3 Legged 5 Why Lessons Learned assessment is required for all Formal Customer Complaints, Major Disruption, and PSCC issues. The KPI to review and publish a Lessons Learned to a Look Across distribution is 20 business days for FCC's/other and 10 business days for PSCC.
   - **Verification**: Verification must take place to ensure corrective action is implemented as planned and that the actions taken were effective in eliminating the problem. The team should agree on the length of time the corrective actions will be monitored prior to verification.

2. **Environmental Corrective and Preventive Actions**
   - **Root Cause Analysis and Corrective Action**: The use of a root cause analysis tool is advantageous to correcting issues the first time and reduces the risk of repeat or similar issues from misidentifying the root cause. A 5-Why or other problem-solving tools should be used as appropriate.
   - **Preventive Action**: Preventive actions are addressed for all corrective actions. Examples include error-proofing processes, design or process changes, and updated or new training requirements.

3. **Corrective Action Process Map**
   - **Problem Definition and Containment Plans**: The document outlines procedures for addressing quality and manufacturing issues through corrective actions, including problem definition, containment plans, and root cause analysis.
   - **Integration with DFMEA and PFMEA**: The process integrates Design and Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA and PFMEA) and emphasizes continual improvement through managing internal audit findings and user feedback.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Documenting Lessons Learned**: Ensure all corrective actions and lessons learned are thoroughly documented in the eQMS system.
2. **Central Repository**: Use a central repository like SharePoint for storing and accessing lessons learned.
3. **Communication Channels**: Utilize internal communication channels such as emails, newsletters, and internal social media platforms.
4. **Training and Workshops**: Conduct training sessions and workshops to educate employees about the lessons learned.
5. **Integration into Procedures**: Update existing procedures and process maps to incorporate the lessons learned.
6. **Feedback Mechanism**: Establish a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement.

By following these steps and utilizing the provided documents, Nexteer Automotive can effectively share lessons learned from corrective actions throughout the organization."

### EPS设计的关键要素

1. **电气过应力（EOS）和静电放电（ESD）保护**：
   - **电气过应力（EOS）**：当电子元件或组件的电压、电流或功率超过其最大限值时，会导致立即损坏或潜在的损坏，从而缩短其使用寿命。EOS的常见根本原因包括电磁辐射场、磁场、系统ESD、闪电、不稳定的测试等。
   - **静电放电（ESD）**：这是两个带电物体之间电流的突然流动，可能导致物理损坏。ESD保护区域（EPA）必须有明确的控制措施，以确保产品不受ESD的影响。

2. **设计和测试**：
   - **系统设计**：确保设计中考虑到电气和热应力的控制，以防止EOS/EIPD损坏。
   - **测试**：在产品验证（PV）阶段进行严格的测试，以确保产品在正常使用中的可靠性。

3. **制造和处理**：
   - **制造过程**：在制造过程中，必须识别并消除可能导致EOS/EIPD损坏的机会。包括适当的焊接、包装和材料选择。
   - **处理和存储**：在处理和存储过程中，必须采取措施防止机械损坏和环境影响。

4. **EPA（静电放电保护区）**：
   - **定义EPA**：在需要处理ESD敏感部件的区域，必须定义并实施基本的ESD控制程序，包括将所有导电和耗散材料连接到已知的地面。
   - **EPA颜色编码**：使用颜色编码来标识不同级别的ESD保护需求。例如，黄色表示标准保护，橙色表示非标准或临时EPA设置。

### 资源和进一步阅读

- **Nexteer内部资源**：你可以访问Nexteer的SharePoint网站，获取更多关于EPS设计和变更管理的信息。
- **全球EOS/ESD程序**：详细的程序和要求可以在Nexteer的全球EOS/ESD程序文档中找到。

1. GB 17675-2021规定了汽车转向系统的术语和定义、技术要求和试验方法，适用于GB/T 15089规定的M类、N类车辆和O类挂车，不适用于气压传动转向系统和定义的带自动转向系统的车辆[GB 17675-2021-5.pdf]。

2. GB 7258-2017规定了机动车的转向系应设置转向限位装置，转向系统在任何操作位置上，不应与其他部件有干涉现象。机动车的方向盘的最大自由转动量应小于或等于15°，三轮汽车为35°，其他机动车为25°[GB 7258-2017-29.pdf][GB 7258-2017-30.pdf]。

3. GB 11557-2011规定了汽车转向机构在正面碰撞过程中对驾驶员伤害方面的技术要求和试验方法，适用于M1类车辆和最大总质量小于1500kg的N1车辆[GB 11557-2011-2.pdf]。

需要注意的是，这些标准可能会有更新，所以在实际应用中需要使用最新版本的标准。"

November: -22652.8342; 
December: 569.1666; 
Yearly: 569.1666; 

Means that total direct production labor in marocco was more expensive in January, February, March and december than forecasted. The performance through entire year was negative with 569.1666USD of loss in this category against budget.

Means that January, October, November, December exchange rate EUR to USD was lower than expected which had negative impact as Nexteer has to exchange USD to EUR to pay for expenses. In other months the exchange rate was positive which means Nexteer needed to exchange less USD to pay the same amount of EUR. The early rate was nagative compared to budgeted which means the overal impact of exchange rate was negative.",

I want you to answer my questions about data I provide. I will provide you financial result for entire year. The data I provide are difference between actual performance and budget. The data I provide are formatted in following way: Category 1, Location, Category 2, currency: Month: Result;

Example: Direct Labor Total - Production, Morocco, Total Product, USD: January: 33086.1437; February: 52623.5804; March: 36203.0289; April: -24507.39; May: -24497.8276; June: -24497.8276; July: -24075.1998; August: -522.3541; September: -24193.3997; October: -22652.8342; November: -22652.8342; December: 569.1666; Yearly: 569.1666;

Means that total direct production labor in marocco was more expensive in January, February, March and december than forecasted. The performance through entire year was negative with 569.1666USD of loss in this category against budget.

Example 2: Average Rate, No Entity, No Product, EUR_USD: January: 0.0006393; February: -0.011788; March: -0.0038023; April: -0.0079088; May: -0.0079088; June: -0.0079088; July: -0.0049249; August: -0.0049249; September: -0.0049249; October: 0.004376; November: 0.004376; December: 0.004376; Yearly: 0.004376;

Means that January, October, November, December exchange rate EUR to USD was lower than expected which had negative impact as Nexteer has to exchange USD to EUR to pay for expenses. In other months the exchange rate was positive which means Nexteer needed to exchange less USD to pay the same amount of EUR. The early rate was nagative compared to budgeted which means the overal impact of exchange rate was negative.",

Means that January, October, November, December exchange rate EUR to USD was lower than expected which had negative impact as Nexteer has to exchange USD to EUR to pay for expenses. In other months the exchange rate was positive which means Nexteer needed to exchange less USD to pay the same amount of EUR. The early rate was nagative compared to budgeted which means the overal impact of exchange rate was negative.",

I want you to answer my questions about data I provide. I will provide you financial result for entire year. The data I provide are difference between actual performance and budget. The data I provide are formatted in following way: Category 1, Location, Category 2, currency: Month: Result;

Example: Direct Labor Total - Production, Morocco, Total Product, USD: January: 33086.1437; February: 52623.5804; March: 36203.0289; April: -24507.39; May: -24497.8276; June: -24497.8276; July: -24075.1998; August: -522.3541; September: -24193.3997; October: -22652.8342; November: -22652.8342; December: 569.1666; Yearly: 569.1666;

Means that total direct production labor in marocco was more expensive in January, February, March and december than forecasted. The performance through entire year was negative with 569.1666USD of loss in this category against budget.

Example 2: Average Rate, No Entity, No Product, EUR_USD: January: 0.0006393; February: -0.011788; March: -0.0038023; April: -0.0079088; May: -0.0079088; June: -0.0079088; July: -0.0049249; August: -0.0049249; September: -0.0049249; October: 0.004376; November: 0.004376; December: 0.004376; Yearly: 0.004376;

Means that January, October, November, December exchange rate EUR to USD was lower than expected which had negative impact as Nexteer has to exchange USD to EUR to pay for expenses. In other months the exchange rate was positive which means Nexteer needed to exchange less USD to pay the same amount of EUR.

I want you to answer my questions about data I provide. I will provide you financial result for entire year. Please firstly respond with brief overview of data. List top 3 most negative impacts and top 3 most positive impacts. Try to explain where those impacts come from.

The data I provide are difference between actual performance and budget. The data I provide are formatted in following way: Category 1, Location, Category 2, currency: Month: Result;

Example: Direct Labor Total - Production, Morocco, Total Product, USD: January: 33086.1437; February: 52623.5804; March: 36203.0289; April: -24507.39; May: -24497.8276; June: -24497.8276; July: -24075.1998; August: -522.3541; September: -24193.3997; October: -22652.8342; November: -22652.8342; December: 569.1666; Yearly: 569.1666;

Means that total direct production labor in marocco was more expensive in January, February, March and december than forecasted. The performance through entire year was negative with 569.1666USD of loss in this category against budget.

Example 2: Average Rate, No Entity, No Product, EUR_USD: January: 0.0006393; February: -0.011788; March: -0.0038023; April: -0.0079088; May: -0.0079088; June: -0.0079088; July: -0.0049249; August: -0.0049249; September: -0.0049249; October: 0.004376; November: 0.004376; December: 0.004376; Yearly: 0.004376;

Means that January, October, November, December exchange rate EUR to USD was lower than expected which had negative impact as Nexteer has to exchange USD to EUR to pay for expenses. In other months the exchange rate was positive which means Nexteer needed to exchange less USD to pay the same amount of EUR. The early rate was nagative compared to budgeted which means the overal impact of exchange rate was negative.",

Here are some of the main challenges:

1. **Risk Management and Mitigation**:
   - **Issue**: Risks were identified, but the actions planned to mitigate these risks were not effective in reducing or eliminating them.
   - **Root Cause**: The guidelines followed to address risks were not in line with the organization's risk management process. Additionally, the team was relatively new to addressing and actioning risks.
   - **Containment Actions**: Re-assess the risk likelihood and impact for identified risks. Revisit all existing actions to mitigate risks and address specific problem areas, such as strengthening the review process to reduce or eliminate recurring defects. Conduct overview sessions on risk management guidelines to improve team awareness.

2. **Change Management Process**:
   - **Issue**: Risks and opportunities were monitored and listed, but the risk tracker needed to be revisited to identify risks specific to technical and project management areas and mitigate them.
   - **Root Cause**: The guidelines followed to address risks were not specific to the organization's risk management process.
   - **Containment Actions**: Conduct overview sessions on the Risk Management Process. Re-assess risk likelihood and impact for identified risks. Revisit all existing actions to mitigate risks and address specific problem areas.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - **Issue**: Root cause analysis conducted for minor defects found during peer reviews was ineffective. There was no well-defined strategy in place to perform root cause analysis.
   - **Root Cause**: The root cause analysis conducted for defects was not as per the standard methodology required to be followed. The team was conducting root cause analysis using the why-why analysis for the first time.
   - **Containment Actions**: Revisit the why-why analysis conducted for minor defects. Discuss the why-why analysis method with the team on how to identify the root cause for a specific problem statement. Revisit the why-why analysis to address process gaps and identify permanent fixes (corrective actions) to the problem defined.

4. **Corrective Action Verification**:
   - **Issue**: The process of corrective action verification was not entirely effective. Actions closed for change over instructions were not yet approved and released to manufacturing.
   - **Root Cause**: The closure of corrective actions was done directly after the implementation of actions without sufficient verification of their effectiveness.
   - **Containment Actions**: Change the method of checking the effectiveness of corrective actions. Train the Quality Team about the new requirement. Update the local procedure by adding the requirement related to the effectiveness check of actions before closure.

5. **Problem Solving Process**:
   - **Issue**: The documented process for problem solving, including root cause analysis, methodology used, analysis, and results, was not completely effective.
   - **Root Cause**: The process was working as intended, but all processes can be improved. The team continually looks for ways to make the process more effective.
   - **Containment Actions**: Create a Closure Checklist for use at Fast Response CA closure. Communicate updates and overdue items to the appropriate staff members for further attention.

These challenges highlight the importance of effective risk management, thorough root cause analysis, and robust verification processes to ensure the successful development and implementation of corrective actions."

     - 3L5why not required...Plant 7 - Need to review current process controls for lessons learned 105186...For all plants, Quality Heads to cascade through their organization the verification of TPM deployment on the manufacturing floor. If information is not readily available, a step approach can be considered based on risk (start with severity 8/9/10 operations first). Specific to this type of equipment:
       1. Filter paper roll sensor needs to be operational to prevent missing paper from filter system. Verify sensor operation. Consider improved sensor design over mechanical lever.
       2. Implement frequent visual checks to verify paper is indexing and aligned properly across the filter bed.
       3. Mechanical aeration (foam) in quench solution can have adverse effect on quenching process during heat treat. Steps to reduce aeration should be taken. Sources of aeration include low tank level, return pump malfunctioning or always on, pump intake partially plugged.
       4. Quench shower ring small holes can partially plug due to contamination. Flow and pressure sensor may not be sensitive enough to detect. Ensure proper frequency and execution of preventative maintenance is followed closely.
       5. Mechanical float operation can malfunction if the float rod becomes bent or deformed causing the float stick in the high level position and not detect the low level in the tank. Implement regular and frequent check for the proper operation of float mechanism. Consider implementing improved tank level sensor technology such as ultrasonic level sensor as a method of tank level detection and management.
       6. Review flow meter signal analysis to improve sensitivity and detection of quench flow issues.
       7. When required, equipment enclosure should be see-through to allow visual inspection of the equipment health as defined by the TPM details.
       8. Ensure that TPM (daily/weekly check run by the operator/team leader) exists and includes as a minimum verification of the possible detection of the failure mode causes described in this issue such as verification of paper presence and indexing, quench ring cleanliness (not plugged), float sensor not bent, quench fluid level, overall cleanliness (no leak, no foam, etc), add PM to clean to pump intake.

     - IATF 10.2.3 Problem solving: The organization shall have a documented process(es) for problem solving including:
       - Root cause analysis, methodology used, analysis, and results.
       - Implementation of systemic corrective actions, including consideration of the impact on similar processes and products.
       - Verification of the effectiveness of implemented corrective actions.
     - The process of corrective action verification isn’t entirely effective. PSCC CA105290 3L5Y actions closed for change over instructions but the PCN to update this document isn’t yet approved and released to manufacturing. Corporate QMS Audit finding from 2021 for Error Proof (EP) bypass was closed by Plant 78 but the same deviation for EP bypass still doesn’t have an EP Bypass verification log. Currently there are 5 EP bypass deviations and none have the EP verification log. In total, 4 of the 11 Corporate QMS Audit findings from 2021 will remain open including the NCRs for Quality Alert, Visual MSA studies and Hold tag process as actions are not yet effective.
   - **Why1 for Occur**: Because the closure of corrective Actions was done directly after the implementation of actions.
   - **Why2 for Occur**: Because the verification of actions effectiveness was performed once the evidences were received.
   - **Why3 for Occur**: Because we don’t give enough time to check the maintain of actions.
   - **Why4 for Occur**: Because we didn’t check many times the effectiveness of actions before the closure.
   - **Why1 for Detection**: Because the effectiveness check was performed according to the due dates set in the system.
   - **Why2 for Detection**: Because no check was done after the closure of the CA.
   - **Why3 for Detection**: Because it was not required to check several times the implementation and maintain of actions before closure.
   - **Why1 for Systemic**: Because we didn’t check many times the effectiveness of actions before the closure.
   - **Why2 for Systemic**: Because it was not mentioned in the local procedure QMS.02.00.00 that we need to check several times the effectiveness of action before closure.
   - **Containment Actions**: 
     - Verification of all findings if all actions are effective and implemented correctly.
     - Change the method of checking the effectiveness of corrective Actions.
     - Train Quality Team about the new requirement.
     - Update the local procedure by adding the requirement related to effectiveness check of actions before closure.
     - Add a new requirement to the local procedure QMS.02.00.00:
       - To check during 60 days several times the effectiveness of actions before closure.
       - Keep evidences of effectiveness check.
     - Train Quality Team about the new requirement.
     - Update the local procedure by adding the requirement related to effectiveness check of actions before closure.

goal of $6 billion in profitable revenue by 2030. That's right, we are aiming high, my friends.
But remember, this is not just about numbers. That's about winning the infinite game. And
to win, we need to be quick, efficient, and globally balanced. We need to think, act, and
operate as one next year. Keeping in mind our vision, mission, and culture. You have
probably heard our saying, think global, act local. This is not just some fancy slogan. This is
our championship strategy. Think of us as midfield maestros. Scanning the pitch,
orchestrating passes, and aiming for the global goalposts. As we navigate towards this
shared future, our decisions must be guided by an overall strategy and a mindset that
focuses on business fundamentals. It is all here in next year's playbook. This playbook is
our game plan. This is our framework that guides our path forward. To be successful, we
must all have a deep understanding of these 10 fundamentals and how they apply to each
of us. Let's take a look at each of them to learn more. Fundamental number one, quality
improvement culture. Let's start with quality. It's foundational in everything we do. It's our
ticket in the door with our customers. It's doing things right the first time and eliminating
waste, which also reduces our operational costs and contributes to the company's overall
financial sustainability. And most importantly, it's a must for keeping millions of people
safe. A quality improvement culture is an organizational mindset. At every level, our
employees embrace a commitment to excellence, placing customer satisfaction at the
forefront. We foster relentless innovation and actively pursue continuous improvement
across our products, services, and processes. We recognize the value of feedback and
view mistakes as opportune tees for growth. Through collaborative relationships, we
collectively uphold a set of shared values, beliefs, and behaviors that prioritize high
standards. Passion for perfect quality is not just a goal, but a fundamental aspect of next
year's identity. At Next Year, quality isn't just a checkbox. It's a process, a culture, a shared
journey we're on together. Whether we're making a part or making a plan, we focus on
hearing quality in the halls, seeing it in every task, feeling it in the pride of a job well done,
and sharing it with those around us. Fundamental number two, standard bill of design, bill
of process, and bill of material with compelling material to source. In our pursuit of
excellence in innovation and profitability, standard bill of design, bill of process, and bill of
materials are at the forefront of our success. These are the base for all other playbook
fundamentals. Our robust technology roadmap is our path to success. Good product
planning is innovative and aligned with market expectations, as well as our own profitability
objectives. Quality and the H&S are always forefront in our thinking. And we must be sure
to design these elements into our bills of design, process, and materials. A technological
and cost-effective bill of design, bill of process, and bill of materials set our company up to
be competitive. And engineering is able to lower our upfront costs by reusing building
blocks and existing processes. With strong bills of design, process, and materials, GSM is
able to establish resilient and competitive purchase part and equipment suppliers, driving
our material rate to sales. And as we pursue new business, sales ensures quality bookings,
which demonstrate financial health, risk management, and profitability in each
opportunity. To meet our CPI financials, architecture teams need to create robust product
and process designs with reliable cost structures as inputs to pursuits. Pursuit teams need
to understand these inputs and ensure thoroughly vetted business cases are developed for
a profitable product offering to the customer. And product development teams, which are
transforming into profit delivery teams, need to understand the pursuit team's
commitments, including the makeup of each key financial metric that they as individuals
can influence. Be conscientious and accountable for every decision they make that
impacts their program's financials, and communicate lessons learned back upstream to
improve the inputs to our future opportunities. We will learn more about CPI financials later
on. Customer focus teams own total account management, including managing positive
squeeze. The term positive squeeze happens when we obtain more cost reductions from
suppliers than we give price reductions to customers. Price reductions must be offset by
any cost reductions, APR, MCIP, economics, etc., to avoid year-over-year deterioration of
profitability. Good rate and flow from our resilient and competitive supply and our
employed next-year production system principles are established through this robust
foundation. And together, these help to ensure our PCNL targets are met and our break-
even points of our manufacturing plants are lowered. Robust bills of design, process, and
materials are our best shield against commoditization and are our enabler to grow
profitably and beat our competition without undermining our profit. Today, we're not just
competing. We're chasing excellence with our growth plan, and this goal comes with new
challenges. Over time, we have seen the average lifetime revenue of a program decline, so
in order to fund this growth, we need to win a greater number of programs. And we need to
spend less on upfront costs. Upfront costs are those that we incur before a program goes
into production, such as engineering and capital. To support the reduction of upfront costs,
we have set two goals. Engineering is 6% of revenue by 2026 and reduce GapX, our capital
spending, by 25%. Let's look at some ways we can reduce upfront costs. First, we can sell
what we have, meaning we find opportunities to gain business on existing products and
technologies. We can also build upon proven technology to minimize engineering costs.
We can strategically apply engineering resources across the globe to maximize
competencies and capabilities, customer support, and cost. And we can leverage
technology such as virtual engineering to increase efficiencies and lower costs. Virtual
engineering enables us to design and test earlier and more thoroughly without requiring the
costs and time of hardware. To reach the target of 25% reduction in GapX spending, we
have four major initiatives. Central manufacturing and product engineering teams work
together during the architecture phase of Bill of Design and Bill of Process to develop
solutions that leverage automation and existing equipment to lower capital costs. Central
manufacturing and the global NPS team work together to centralize data in a single
database, allowing visibility of next year's current global capacity utilization for all regions
and product lines. This data informs production placement decisions by highlighting where
existing equipment may be underutilized and could be retooled rather than purchasing all
new equipment somewhere else. Central manufacturing and GSM indirect purchasing
work together to create global machine and equipment purchasing strategies. And central
manufacturing and global operations teams jointly develop strategies around capitalizing
for actual volume forecasts rather than full contract volume. By taking these actions to
lower upfront costs, we can offset the declining market prices from generation to
generation, allowing next year to remain competitive and profitable. And we can maintain a
high level of utilization of our current assets amid program volume fluctuations.
Fundamental number four, resilient and competitive supply chain with contracted APR and
matching clauses. Did you know? About two-thirds of our revenue is made up of
components we purchase. Without a competitive and resilient supply, we cannot deliver
competitive products with the right level of performance to our customers. So let's first
consider what we can do to ensure competitive supply. One way is through TCM
methodology applied at the time of sourcing. TCM, or Target Cost Model, is a systematic
approach to managing costs throughout the lifecycle of a program. Think of it like a
budgeting strategy. It helps us keep track of how much money we spend from start to finish,
and creates an agreement between next year and the supplier on an established ideal cost
for a component based on existing best price and financial analysis. We also keep watch
over time and make minor enhancements as appropriate to make sure next year is not
paying for unnecessary things, such as inefficiencies or overstated costs by the supplier.
Additionally, we need to ensure both our customer and supplier contracts include
matching clauses to protect us from things like material escalation. Without protection
that allows us to pass on or offset price increases from our suppliers, our profitability can
be significantly and negatively impacted due to economic circumstances beyond our
control. We'll talk more about this squeeze management later. Similarly, as our customers
are seeking annual price reductions, or APRs, as part of our contract, we must have
contracted annual price reductions with our suppliers as well. APRs drive a commitment
and motivation for suppliers to continuously seek cost improvement opportunities during
the life of the agreement. These APRs are part of standard business practices in our mass
volume industry. Remember, the term positive squeeze happens when we obtain more cost
reductions from suppliers than we give price reductions to customers. A key contributor to
positive squeeze is MCIP, which stands for Material Cost Improvement Plan. MCIP is our
plan to continuously improve our product cost efficiency. By achieving positive squeeze, we
enhance or maintain margins while satisfying our customer in their expectation for price
reductions over the life of a program. While GSM develops and executes strategies to
reduce material costs, sales develops and executes strategies not to share all those
savings, allowing next year to better capitalize on our continuous improvement. Beyond
competitive, we need to make sure our supply is resilient, meaning we can count on it
despite changing economic conditions and unplanned events. One way to ensure
resiliency is by dual sourcing. This means we have more than one supplier approved to
supply a part or material. Dual sourcing ensures there is a consistent competitive tension
between suppliers in cost, quality, and relationship. It also provides a level of protection to
next year from voluntary and involuntary supply chain disruptions. Supplier quality systems
and procedures are also very important. These establish standards and consistency for
next year in our suppliers globally. More importantly, with a global footprint and dynamic
and unpredictable environment, systems and procedures allow next year to fully
comprehend potential supplier risks and enable us to formulate mitigation plans. This is a
must as we work to improve our competitiveness by expanding our supplier portfolio to
benchmark cost disruptive suppliers across the globe. Fundamental number five, quality of
bookings. As we pursue new business, we must ensure financial health, risk management,
and profitability of each opportunity. Quality of bookings is a measure of financial
robustness when securing a new business win. It is imperative that we employ our
playbook fundamentals and key financial metrics during each pursuit. Let's take a look at
our key financial indicators. Operating income calculates the profitability score for our
program. Net present value represents the value we create for the company after having
invested our own resources like CapEx, engineering, or any other cost. Material rate to
sales assesses the cost of materials as a percentage of expected revenue. It helps us
estimate how much money will be left after paying suppliers to ensure we have enough to
cover our costs to operate efficiently and to generate profit. Our material rate to sales
target of 60% is based on the fact that we have been historically profitable at this level.
Engineering rate to sales is the cost of engineering as a percentage of expected revenue. It
keeps our target of reduced upfront costs in check. Manufacturing rate to sales is the cost
of manufacturing as a percentage of expected revenue. This keeps our eye on efficient
production and cost containment. A quality booking is a program that presents calculated
profitability with minimal risk and uncertainty. These financial indicators form our first line
of defense for the profitability of a project. Beyond financials, we must also assess the
unaddressed or invisible risks or uncertainty a project is carrying, such as non-availability
of customer requirements. Without meeting customer needs, our program falters. GSM, bill
of material price estimations. Accurate estimates of the materials needed are essential.
Too high, and we foul out. Too low, and we're caught off guard. Warranty or quality targets
are our defensive wall. Meeting quality standards protects our reputation. A leaky defense
here, and we lose credibility. Sales price offering below market price. Our opportunity to
grab the business away from our competitors, but tread carefully. Too low, and we undercut
ourselves. Sustainability targets driven by our own goals, our customer requirements, or
government regulations. For an exchange rate fluctuations in variable volumes, as well as
economic cost evolution, which can include things like inflation, new labor cost
agreements, variable energy, and freight costs, and so on. And finally, the market price
range. Our challenge is to make sure we secure business at the upper limit of the range.
With these measures, we've analyzed the financial stats, guarded against risks, and assess
the unseen challenges to ensure we have a program poised for success. Fundamental
number six, deliver CPI financials. Customer Program Implementation, or CPI, is next
year's business process for planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing
activities and risks associated with launching a program from the time of project charter
through customer start of production, plus an additional six months of continuous
improvement activities before handing the program over to manufacturing. The CPI process
includes controlling financials, resources, timing, and quality throughout all project
deliverables, such as product and manufacturing system design, development and
implementation, logistics planning and execution, supplier selection and sourcing, and
more. Delivering CPI financials means that we achieve the program's financial targets when
we reach production. This is measured during the launch of new programs as a comparison
between baseline financials and the financials at the time of start of production, or SOP,
plus six months. There are many additional financial elements in each program's business
case, and they all roll up into two main deliverables, OI, percent, and NPV dollars. These
two values provide the highest level overview of a program's financial performance. Let's
break it down. OI stands for operating income. Think of OI as the profitability score for a
program. It tells us how well the program is doing financially. If OI is positive, the program is
making money. If OI is negative, it's losing money. NPV stands for net present value.
Imagine you're planning to invest in something. NPV helps you decide if it's a good
investment. It considers the timing of cash flows, which means money coming in and going
out. Here's how it works. You estimate how much money you'll get in the future, or cash-in
flows. You also estimate how much you'll spend, or cash-out flows. NPV calculates the
current value of these future cash flows. If NPV is positive, it's a good investment which
creates value for the company. If NPV is negative, it devalues the company by requiring
company resources without generating any return on the investment of those resources. OI
tells us how profitable the program is right now, and NPV helps us decide if it's a smart
financial move in the long run. Why is this important? Next year's profitability in the future is
determined by the programs we have currently in the CPI phase. Delivering financial
performance of these programs is paramount. The decisions we make today frame the
conditions of sustainable profitability for the life of the program. During this phase, we're
setting up the right conditions for long-term success. Next year wants these programs to be
profitable when they're in production. This is called the serial life stage, so we're making
sure everything aligns with our financial goals. Essentially, CPI is like turning a promise
from the business plan into real money when the program is up and running. To be
successful, this takes full team effort, integrity, and accountability from start to finish.
Architecture teams need to create robust product and process designs with reliable cost
structures as inputs to pursuits. Pursuit teams need to understand these inputs Ensure
thoroughly vetted business cases are developed for a profitable product offering to the
customer and product development teams, or what we like to call profit delivery teams,
need to understand the pursuit team's commitments, understand the makeup of each key
financial metric that they as individuals can influence, be conscientious and accountable
for every decision they make that impacts their program's financials, and communicate
lessons learned back upstream to improve the inputs to our future opportunities. Focusing
on the 10 business fundamentals of next year's playbook throughout all program-related
activities is necessary to ensure profitability when the program is launched.
Fundamental number seven, Squeeze Management. If we want to have a sustainable
business model, we need to find ways to drive a positive squeeze. As a reminder, a positive
squeeze happens when we obtain more cost reduction from suppliers than we give price
reductions to customers. Customer price reductions, either through expected annual price
reductions, known as APRs, or other ways, must be offset by reductions in material cost.
While also important, manufacturing and structural cost productivity helps us offset
inflation and enhance our profit and should not be relied on to offset customer price
reductions. To ensure a strong future, we must manage the squeeze on both new and
current business. How can we do this? For new business, instead of an overall profit view,
we must look at the year-over-year profitability for all new business pursuits. We must
make sure there are offsetting material reductions for all contracted price reductions. And
our customer and supplier contracts must also have matching clauses to protect us from
things like material escalation. Any economic demands from our supply base, such as
material, logistics, or energy increases, must have an offsetting mechanism, ideally
passing the increases onto our customers. For current business, all customer price
reductions must be offset with material cost improvement plans, known as MCIP, or other
cost reduction ideas. Fundamental number eight, production control and logistics.
Production control and logistics, or PCNL, interacts with nearly every part of our business.
Imagine them as the bridge builders, connecting different functions within our company.
The goal, optimize, optimize, optimize. We have a mission to develop and execute global
value streams. These streams do three important things. They boost operational efficiency
in our plants, they improve our company's financial performance, and they manage critical
global resources, like people and cash. We move billions of dollars in inventory around the
world through our value streams each year. PCNL defines optimized value streams starting
from our suppliers to our manufacturing, and all the way through to our customers.
Material flow is the heartbeat of production. The global PCNL team takes great pride in
assuring that the right parts are in the right place at the right time, and at the right or best
cost every time. This drives customer satisfaction, both internally and externally, and
enables effective, cost-efficient operations, both within Nextyear and at our customers. We
have an important goal to reach 15 days of inventory by 2026. Let's talk about what this
means. You may have heard the term, just-in-time inventory. This means we aim to produce
just enough product at just the right time to hold as little inventory as possible. Why? Did
you know, one day of outstanding inventory is worth around $12 million for Nextyear? You
heard it right, $12 million. Each day improved creates additional cash for the company,
which can be used to fund new programs, technologies, and innovations. PCNL aims to
continuously monitor, evaluate, and improve our value streams, helping to reduce waste
costs such as overtime, logistics costs, and premium freight, excess inventory, and scrap.
All of these actions improve company profitability and cashflow performance. And our
advanced PCNL gets in early with value stream development, helping to drive good
business decisions to support new business growth and successful launches. One way is
by using material flow to influence production process layouts. It's like arranging puzzle
pieces for maximum efficiency. Fundamental number nine, Nextyear Production System.
The Nextyear Production System, or NPS, is an effective lean production approach that has
greatly improved efficiency and quality. NPS aims to eliminate waste and produce high-
quality products efficiently, delivering maximum value to the customer. It's doing things
right the first time with quality in mind. Although NPS is typically associated with
manufacturing, waste is not limited to the manufacturing process. It can include product
design, purchasing, administration, sales, and service. Waste can be excess paperwork,
unnecessary meetings, redundant tasks, errors, delays, over-processing, over-
communication, and so on. You can use NPS methodologies to create standardized
processes, understand how your daily work and personal objectives tie back to the overall
goals of the organization, and provide suggestions for improvements no matter how big or
small they may be. By leveraging global best practices and best-in-class solutions, we can
eliminate waste and optimize our cost structure and company competitiveness, adding to
our bottom line. In this competitive environment with year-over-year customer price
reductions, it's imperative that we focus on continuous improvements that increase our
efficiencies and reduce costs. Continuous improvement is key, but what's even more
important is ensuring that this operational excellence is sustainable and rooted in our
organization's culture, becoming a part of our very DNA. Our NPS vision calls for each and
every one of us to think critically and adopt a culture of continuous improvement on a daily
basis. It represents our unwavering commitment to continuous improvement as an
organization, and we all play a vital role in this journey. Fundamental number 10, breakeven
point management at plant, division, and corporate level. We've come to our last
fundamental, breakeven point management. Our breakeven point is the minimum level of
revenue that we need to offset our costs, resulting in neither profit or loss. We must
manage this at the plan, divisional, and corporate levels. When the margin percentage or
contribution per unit is known, we can calculate the number of units we need to sell to
achieve the breakeven point by dividing the fixed costs by the margin percentage per unit.
Let's use bread as an example. A baker is preparing and selling loaves of bread. He has
calculated that he will have $1.50 in variable costs for ingredients and electricity to make
each loaf of bread. He has also calculated that he can sell each loaf of bread in the
competitive market at $2.50 each. This brings him a profit margin or contribution of $1 per
loaf. The baker also has the fixed costs of $1,000 per year to lease his bakery building. The
baker divides this $1,000 by the $1 margin for a loaf of bread to realize he must sell 1,000
loaves or $2,500 in revenue to breakeven. Each additional loaf of bread that he is able to
sell beyond the first 1,000 loaves will bring an additional $1 in profit. If all things stayed the
same, this sounds simple, but in our VUCA world, customer volumes have now become
much more variable and unpredictable, and economic conditions also add a challenge
with unanticipated fluctuating material, logistics, and energy costs as examples. In order to
stay in the game, we must be able to adapt our material rate to sales and structural costs to
lower our breakeven point. Controlling our breakeven point as a percent of revenue is key to
our resilience and profitability throughout market changes. We must make sure that all new
programs begin with as much profitability or contribution as possible and that we are taking
key steps such as designing for efficient manufacturing and negotiating squeeze
protections with the quickly changing environment. It's also important that we continue to
reassess in real time and take actions to maintain the right level to ensure our programs
remain profitable. Let's go back to the bread example. Imagine the baker has a customer
with a standing order for 10 loaves per month. However, due to a storm, that customer's
restaurant must close down for six months to repair the damage. During this closure, the
customer has canceled his orders. The baker must now find a way to reduce his costs to
offset the loss of this revenue. Because he is locked into his lease and cannot renegotiate
the terms, he must look at his material rate to sales. Remember, this is the cost of
materials as a percentage of expected revenue. He finds that by switching to another
supplier, he can lower his cost of flour by 10%. In the same way this baker assessed the
situation and adjusted, we must continuously assess our business and the variable factors
which impact us. And we must take action to make appropriate adjustments to ensure a
profitable business. So as you can see, these 10 fundamentals are not separate initiatives.
Everything within these focus areas is interconnected. Just as we are interconnected. As a
reminder, quality and the H and S are always forefront in our thinking. And we must be sure
to design these elements into our bills of design, process, and materials. A technological
and cost-effective bill of design, bill of process, and bill of materials set our company up to
be competitive. And engineering is able to lower our upfront costs by reusing building
blocks and existing processes. With strong bills of design, process, and materials, GSM is
able to establish resilient and competitive purchase part and equipment suppliers, driving
our material rate to sales. And as we pursue new business, sales ensures quality bookings,
which demonstrate financial health, risk management, and profitability in each
opportunity. All of these areas impact our ability to meet CPI financials. Architecture teams
need to create robust product and process designs with reliable cost structures as inputs
to pursuits. Pursuit teams need to understand these inputs and ensure thoroughly vetted
business cases are developed for a profitable product offering to the customer. And
product development teams, which are transforming into profit delivery teams, need to
understand the pursuit team's commitments, including the makeup of each key financial
metric that they as individuals can influence, be conscientious and accountable for every
decision they make that impacts their program's financials, and communicate lessons
learned back upstream to improve the inputs to our future opportunities. Customer focus
teams own total account management, including managing positive squeeze. The term
positive squeeze happens when we obtain more cost reductions from suppliers than we
give price reductions to customers. Price reductions must be offset by any cost reductions,
APR, MCIP, economics, et cetera, to avoid year-of-year deterioration of profitability. Good
rate and flow from our resilient and competitive supply in our employed NPS principles are
established through this robust foundation. And together, these help to ensure our PC and
L targets are met and our break-even points of our manufacturing plants are lowered.
Reaching our shared future of a profitable $6 billion in revenue by 2040 takes effort and
actions from every function and every employee globally. Our decisions must be guided by
an overall strategy and a mindset that focuses on these business fundamentals of our
playbook to strengthen our resiliency and readiness for the challenges ahead. And our one-
next-year culture remains critical for how we will get things done, together, collaboratively,
and as one team. Just as this balanced approach to revenue and profitability ensures our
long-term financial health and competitiveness, so too does our pursuit to be a globally
balanced company driven by strong, integrated divisions capable of speed and execution.
And through our Think Global, Act Local approach, we are empowered to act to win in our
local markets. We stand at the cusp of transformation, marked by growth mindset,
becoming a learning organization, and igniting change with passion. Every step taken is
part of moving from knowing what happened to understanding what needs to be done, from
clarity in diagnosis to actionable path forward respecting business fundamentals. The next-
year playbook is for all of us. It embodies our organizational why, empowering each one of
us with the freedom to transcend boundaries. Team, victory is ours for the taking. Let's
claim it. Victory dances are encouraged. Bonus points for the moonwalking, because
together we are just unstoppable.",

   - **Lesson Learned Problem Description**: During Assembly on June 2nd, 2017, GM Fort Wayne assembly plant reported one REPS unit with loss of assist. Nexteer Plant 3 (Saginaw, MI) investigation determined the Probe Housing was not properly secured to the Rack Housing. Due to one of the Probe Housing screw depth being too shallow. *See attached 3L5Y for additional information*
   - **Specific/Systemic Cause**: DIM/FUNCT_Inspection and Testing (G1735)
   - **Lesson Learned Root Cause**: Due to operator error, the drill length offset value was incorrectly entered into the CNC Chiron ""F"". The error was not detected because the operator did not check the first part after tool change. Systemically, lack of a documented tracking system correlating tool offset value and tool change, and inadequate tool change instructions led to the failure. The corrective actions taken were to update gage instructions, update tool change/offset instructions to use offset label printer and tool change tag, a flush pin depth gage was created and a depth check was added, a depth check was added to the CMM, and a review of tool changes by the Team Leader and a Group Leader layered audit for tool change were implemented.
   - **Lessons Learned**: To prevent drilling shallow holes, for drilling operations, ensure the offset and tool check information is tracked and from tool setup to tool change. Clarify tool change instructions/offset instructions to include use of offset label printer and tool change tag. Additionally, review/audit to ensure proper tool change and add necessary gaging/inspection for drill depth.

   - **Lesson Learned Problem Description**: On 07AP2018, Nexteer Plant 3 (Saginaw, Michigan) received a warranty REPS gear from the W program from dealer 45523 in Los Angeles, California. The vehicle presented with binding steering when turning left or right and did not self-center. Upon further inspection, the binding condition was caused by a fractured retaining ring from tool impact during BSI. *See attached 3L5Y for additional information*
   - **Specific/Systemic Cause**: NoData
   - **Lesson Learned Root Cause**: The fractured retaining ring was caused by contact between the drive key on the M90 tightening tool and the retaining ring during advance motion on BSI OP50. The contact between the retaining ring was caused by the screw that holds the serviceable drive key finger being bent [in contact path]. Packaging would not allow a robust screw size--resultant was a stretched screw, which allowed loosening. Due to innate retention of ball guide from design, function testing did not detect retaining ring damage/failure. Additionally, a lack of scheduled inspection of drive keys did not detect the cause of ring contact. Systemically, the PFMEA did not evaluate damage to components not directly affected by the operation.
   - **Lessons Learned**: Must consider how tooling failures may interact with high severity features. Verify PM schedule includes at least daily audit of tooling using a gage to ensure details of are not bent, worn, or broken.

   - **Issued Date**: 2017-06-23
   - **Customer Problem Description**: See Nexteer description
   - **Lesson Learned Problem Description**: After Assembly on March 17th, 2017 BMW reported uneven handwheel travel (from lock to lock) in 1 BMW Brilliance Automotive UKL vehicle. Part was returned to Plant 77. Upon initial inspection by Nexteer Plant 77, (Tychy, Poland) the cause of the uneven travel was a missing insert ring inside the system (Left side). * See attached 3L5Y for additional information*
   - **Specific/Systemic Cause**: NoData
   - **Lesson Learned Root Cause**: During the assembly process, the insert ring vacuum holding system was not always capable of holding the insert ring in place during the entire travel of the press head. The insert ring fell from the pressing head while moving into the rack housing. As a result, the insert ring staking operation was performed without an insert ring present. For non-conformance correction, the Header design has been improved to prevent the insert ring from falling during insertion. Machine Logic check for insert ring presence only took place at the loading position and press load monitoring was missing in the initial portion of the press curve, allowing for the insert ring to be missing without detection. For future detection, a pressing window was implemented to detect initial press load on the insert ring staking operation, and rack travel limits implemented on Centering stations. The uneven handwheel travel of the full assembly was not detected because too high rack travel was not identified in the PFMEA and no control was defined in the process. Systemically, poor risk analysis, failure to implement Quality Alert Corrective Actions for pressing operations on machines, and lack resolution of Actis for IR pressing problem led to the failure. Poor risk analysis was caused by an incorrect approach to PFMEA process (focus on characteristics instead of their tolerances) and poor attendance of the PFMEA review. For improved risk analysis, an action plan was defined to improve PFMEA reviews and their supervision and all BMW PFMEAs reviewed to ensure controls are in place for potential characteristics where an operation is indirectly linked to a customer requirement. QA Corrective Actions were not implemented on TY1076 & TY 1057. The lines were reviewed according to the QA requirements, but TY1057 was missed. Identification of severity 9/10 characteristics was based on best ME knowledge not PFMEA. For TY1076, MQ2 was performed after Global CQA submissions and was not part of the action from CQA (August 8th, 2014). The CQA was treated as a single event and the requirements were not reflected in systemic documents for new machines. For improvement, for each QA concerning process, a PFMEA review must be initiated. Bill of Process (BOP) reflecting CQA to be defined. Actis for IR pressing problem not resolved due to insufficient prioritization process for Actis projects. For Resolution, Prioritization of severity 9/10 Actis projects to be implemented and High severity notification will be sent to the VS and Quality Managers.
   - **Lessons Learned**: Total rack travel defined for a gear variant shall be tested in the production process and stored. If a vacuum system is used to position a part, an additional sensor is required to ensure part location is maintained through the entire cycle.

### Report 1:
- **Customer**: GM
- **Product Line**: REPS
- **Customer Location**: GM FTQ - Ft. Wayne, IN
- **Complain Type**: 0Km Formal
- **Corrective Action Type**: RMA /Quality
- **Location**: Plant 103 Saginaw
- **Part Number**: 38013931
- **Issued Date**: 2017-06-02
- **Customer Problem Description**: See Nexteer Description.
- **Lesson Learned Problem Description**: During Assembly on June 2nd, 2017, GM Fort Wayne assembly plant reported one REPS unit with loss of assist. Nexteer Plant 3 (Saginaw, MI) investigation determined the Probe Housing was not properly secured to the Rack Housing. Due to one of the Probe Housing screw depth being too shallow.
- **Specific/Systemic Cause**: DIM/FUNCT_Inspection and Testing (G1735)
- **Lesson Learned Root Cause**: Due to operator error, the drill length offset value was incorrectly entered into the CNC Chiron ""F"". The error was not detected because the operator did not check the first part after tool change. Systemically, lack of a documented tracking system correlating tool offset value and tool change, and inadequate tool change instructions led to the failure.
- **Lessons Learned**: To prevent drilling shallow holes, for drilling operations, ensure the offset and tool check information is tracked and from tool setup to tool change. Clarify tool change instructions/offset instructions to include use of offset label printer and tool change tag. Additionally, review/audit to ensure proper tool change and add necessary gaging/inspection for drill depth.

### 3. **Customer: GM**
- **Product Line**: Half Shaft
- **Customer Location**: GM FTQ - Spring Hill, TN
- **Complain Type**: Internal/General
- **Corrective Action Type**: Lessons Learned
- **Location**: Plant 105 Saginaw
- **Part Number**: 38226741
- **Issued Date**: 2017-07-21
- **Customer Problem Description**: See Nexteer Description.
- **Lesson Learned Problem Description**: During customer testing on 21 July 2017, GM reported 4 D2UX & C1UG intermediate drive shafts that did not meet torsional fatigue requirements to Plant 5 (Saginaw, MI). Upon initial inspection, the failure to meet the requirements was due to quench cracks present on the IDS. *See attached 3L5Y for additional information*
- **Specific/Systemic Cause**: NoData

#### Lesson Learned Root Cause:
- Compromised signal integrity during crack check from inadequate lubrication on the ultrasonic test probe lead to the quench cracks not being detected. Inadequate lubrication on the probe was the result of the operator manually reducing water flow because the sensor reservoir was overflowing from a clogged drain line. Additionally, the cracks were not detected due to the machine being allowed to run without check against master. The master was out for repair and the check was moved to the met lab. Poor hand-off between met lab and operations resulted in the check against the master not being completed after the return of the master. Systemically, lack of interrupted/intermittent signal check on OCP, the failure mode not being identified on the PFMEA, and missing process flow/input control understanding for the equipment lead to the failure.

#### Lessons Learned:
- 100% Signal Verification or Reject Default response required for UT check type device/systems.

1. **100% Monitoring of Process Control Parameters**: If 100% part inspection is not feasible, ensure that process control parameters are 100% monitored and identified as Key Control Characteristics (KCC) in the control plan. This should include an appropriate verification plan and detection method with required documentation.

2. **Part Inspection or Process Monitoring**: Conduct part inspection or process monitoring for all components and assemblies within the manufacturing facility. Any exceptions that result in 100% verification downstream at Nexteer instead of at the supplier must be approved based on the effectiveness of controls.

3. **Incoming Inspection of Sub-Supplier Material**: When necessary, incoming inspection of sub-supplier material should be consistent with the risk and quality impact. This includes using variable data as a key indicator for sub-supplier quality management and ensuring containment is in place for high-risk processes.

4. **Zero Defects Expectation**: Select sub-suppliers based on their capability to maintain robust processes that meet all Nexteer’s product requirements with an expectation of zero defects.

5. **Supplier Quality Engineer Participation**: The Nexteer Supplier Quality Engineer may participate in sub-supplier on-site visits and/or audits to ensure compliance.

1. **Controlled Shipping**:
   - **Controlled Shipping Level 1 (CS1)**: Implement an additional inspection process separate from the PPAP approved process controls at the supplier's manufacturing facility.
   - **Controlled Shipping Level 2 (CS2)**: Implement an additional inspection process above and beyond CS1, conducted by a third party. The third-party inspection company should be selected by the supplier and approved by Nexteer Supplier Quality.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain a sort log and timesheets to document the sorting activities.
   - Ensure that any third-party sorting costs not paid directly by the responsible supplier are documented.

3. **Response to Nonconforming Material**:
   - If nonconforming material is found, a clearly defined reaction plan must be in place. This plan should include robust communication throughout the supplier's organization and to Nexteer, ensuring that defective parts are 100% contained.

4. **Verification and Inspection**:
   - Use variable or attribute gages for 100% verification of function-critical product dimensions. This can include functional or go/no-go checks.
   - Ensure that plant floor documentation is maintained, and specific documentation requirements are defined on the control plan based on process capability.

Here are the key steps and procedures based on the retrieved documents:

### 1. Pre-Employment Procedures
- **Requisition for Hire (RFH):** The process begins with the approval of a Requisition for Hire (RFH) by the HR Business Partner and relevant supervisors.
- **Pre-Employment Medical Exams:** Candidates must undergo pre-employment medical exams and submit necessary documents.
- **Document Submission:** Candidates provide completed documents to the HR department at least five business days before the employment start date.

### 2. First Day Procedures
- **Account Creation:** HR creates employee accounts and notifies IT to set up email addresses and other necessary IT resources.
- **Initial Training:** New hires undergo an initial training block covering workplace safety, job responsibilities, and other essential information.
- **Job Familiarization:** New hires are familiarized with their job responsibilities and receive a personal permit to move around the plant.
- **Workwear and ID:** New hires complete a workwear handover report and receive an ID number, with their data uploaded into the HR and payroll system.

### 3. On-the-Job Training (OJT)
- **Duration:** OJT lasts about two months for hourly employees and includes a structured skill matrix requiring progression through four competence levels.
- **Training Plan:** Supervisors prepare detailed OJT plans and monitor progress, with HR assisting in developing training materials.
- **Evaluation:** New hires must pass an exam and achieve a minimum score before joining their new department. Performance assessments occur after 3-6 months for salaried employees and 1.5-3 months for hourly employees.

### 4. Continuous Improvement and Compliance
- **Training Needs Identification (TNI):** Training needs are identified based on annual objectives, competency mapping, and customer-specific requirements.
- **Annual Training Plan:** HR releases an annual training plan, and training effectiveness is monitored quarterly.
- **Documentation:** All training activities are documented, and regular refresher training is emphasized, especially for safety-critical roles.

1. **Wire Transfer**: In exceptional cases, payments may be made via wire transfer, requiring documentation such as an approved PTD, advance payment deviation, and Bill of Lading from the supplier. The Corporate Treasury or local Finance Department handles the execution of wire transfers [nexteer AUTOMOTIVE 5.1.4.106].

2. **Supplier Deposits**: For Cash In Advance terms, a deposit agreement is used since the payment system cannot handle these items. This requires a PTD and wire transfer to process the deposit [nexteer AUTOMOTIVE 5.1.4.106].

3. **Payment Term Deviations**: If a supplier requests a change in payment terms, the buyer negotiates to maintain or improve terms. If a change is necessary, a PTD must be completed and approved by the appropriate regional directors and finance approvers [nexteer AUTOMOTIVE 5.1.4.106].

4. **Accounts Payable Procedure**: Payment requests must be submitted with supporting documents such as invoices, contracts, and inspection reports. Special attention is required for imported fixed assets, where installation and design fees must be declared to customs [nexteer AUTOMOTIVE 耐世特(中国)有限公司].

5. **Payment Runs**: Payments are made according to a schedule determined by Finance, such as daily, twice a month, or monthly. Items must be entered into the Accounts Payable system by the deadline to be included in the next payment run [nexteer AUTOMOTIVE 5.1.4.106].

These processes ensure that supplier payments are handled efficiently and in compliance with company policies."

1. **Submit Request**: The requester submits a request to create, modify, or inactivate supplier master data along with supporting documents. The requester is responsible for the authenticity, completeness, and accuracy of the submitted information.
2. **Supervisor Verification**: The direct supervisor of the requester verifies the necessity of inviting a new supplier to Nexteer business or the request for supplier information change. The supervisor also verifies the accuracy of the data submitted in BPM compared with the information from the supplier-provided supporting documents.
3. **Approval**: The request is then subject to approval. The leader and finance department review and approve the request.
4. **Synchronization to SAP**: After approval, the maintenance actions are synchronized to SAP to generate or update the vendor master data.

Here is an outline of the MQ process:

1. **Traceability System Verification**: 
   - Perform traceability system verification as outlined in the MQ1 Traceability System Verification.
   - Verify rework/reintroduction processes according to an established rework procedure.

2. **Traceability System Deployment and Validation**:
   - Verify the interactions of the complete system.
   - Perform MQ2 individually per machine according to the program schedule.
   - Test permissions from one cell as part of the entire system validation.
   - Include support from the Purchasing Manufacturing Engineer and Quality Engineer as part of the PFMEA process.
   - Conduct robust traceability testing that stresses the entire system, including the deliberate introduction of known incorrect part numbers and statuses into each station.

3. **Bill of Materials (BOM) Entry**:
   - PE enters BOM from Teamcenter, including BOM Level, Item Number, Rev, Change Level, Item Name, Qty, Make or Buy, Carry-Over or New.
   - Eliminate any non-directed buy sub-components from the BOM.

4. **PV Build Quantity**:
   - PE enters PV Build Quantity defined by Validation Engineering based on the preliminary test plan and customer requirements.

5. **Sequence Chart Entry**:
   - Lead ME uses Sequence Chart to enter the name of Machine/Cell Name/Operation and whether it is New (MQ1) or Retool Equipment (MQ2) for each operation the component is associated with.

6. **Lead-Time Determination**:
   - Lead ME provides the total lead-time from machine kick-off to MQ1 by Machine/Cell Name/Operation.
   - Utilize a separate planning document to map part flow for MQ1 run-off.

7. **T-Spec Due Date**:
   - Lead ME determines T-Spec Due Date (Drawing at CCR Status & EDA Complete) based on ME Sourcing Timeline.

8. **Purchase Requisition Due Date**:
   - Lead ME determines Purchase Requisition Due Date (Equipment Kickoff) based on machine lead-time and MQ1 Due Date.
   - Enter Debug, MQ1, MQ2 material required quantity.

9. **Material Required Dates**:
   - Lead ME determines Debug Material Required Date, MQ1 Material Required Date, and MQ2 Material Required Date based on the required first Build Date in Nexteer Manufacturing Plant.
   - Consider machine lead-time, shipment, and qualification (including PVR/LSR).

10. **Preliminary MSD-1 and MSD-2 Dates**:
    - PM and Lead ME establish preliminary MSD-1 dates based on T-Spec and MSD-2 dates based on MQ1 timing.

11. **Supplier Lead-Time**:
    - GSM provides the total lead-time from supplier kick-off to PPAP Submission (OTS) for each new PN.
    - Carry over parts and capacity increase confirmations are set to be completed 12 weeks after Intelex record creation.

12. **PFMEA Updates**:
    - Update Initial PFMEA based on the latest revisions of the drawing/DSS to verify any changes.
    - Evaluate risks and ensure detection controls are adequate.
    - Re-evaluate RPN, AP, HPAD as part of the MQ1 and Initial PFMEA process.
    - Document results and ensure agreement to move to production.

These steps ensure a comprehensive and systematic approach to machine qualification, covering all necessary aspects from traceability to material requirements and risk evaluation."

It is a document or process used within Nexteer Automotive to manage and approve the procurement of goods and services. Here are some key points related to PRR:

1. **PO Modifications**:
   - If the Purchase Order (PO) value is less than the PR value, no modification to the PR is needed, and the variance is considered a cost saving.
   - If the PO value is greater than the PR value, a new PR is required to cover the gap between the PR and PO values.

2. **Investment and Non-Investment PR**:
   - For investment PR, a new PR is required regardless of the variance value.
   - For non-investment PR:
     - If the PO value is less than or equal to $10,000, a new PR is required only if the gap exceeds 10% of the original PR value.
     - If the PO value is greater than $10,000, a new PR is required regardless of the variance value.

3. **CRIB Ordering**:
   - New materials require PR approvals, and the first order for new crib items is based on an approved PR.
   - Weekly reports are generated to replenish stock based on items below the minimum level.

4. **Quality Control**:
   - Approval of the invoice indicates satisfaction with the quality of the item/service and delivery.

5. **Shipping and Labeling**:
   - PRS documents and ERCs are used for preparing shipments, and visual inspections are performed to ensure label accuracy before shipping finished goods.

These points highlight the importance of PRR in managing procurement processes, ensuring accurate financial tracking, and maintaining quality control within Nexteer Automotive."
2bbcf523-51ff-f38c-5300-1f4094e910b5,2091c78b-80c8-e19b-3aa0-d00d960e37be,CPIDATA,1725900453.364182,What about PRR for part revision change,"For part revision changes, the PRR (Purchase Requisition Request) process involves several key steps and considerations to ensure proper documentation, approval, and implementation. Here are the main points:

1. **Part Approval Documentation**:
   - Part approval records and documentation are stored in the Intelex PPAP application and must be easily accessible for review with the customer.
   - Evidence of customer approval is required.

2. **Trial Run Requirements**:
   - Customer trial run requirements must be followed as documented in customer-specific requirements.
   - Nexteer may decide to run a Production Trial Run (PTR) if the change impacts critical quality levels (QCL 1 through 5), safety/compliance, fit/function product/process characteristics, or other special characteristics.
   - The Plant Quality Manager specifies the length of the PTR, and the PPAP run or Run at Rate may be considered the PTR.

3. **Change Control and Documentation**:
   - Changes that drive a new part number require documentation in a Change Control Released (CCR) drawing and a Product Type Deviation.
   - The new part number must be a CCR and have Electronic Document Approval (EDA).
   - A DSS Audit is required to be approved, and the Supplier Kickoff Approval field in Teamcenter must be marked ""Yes.""
   - The ECR (Engineering Change Request) attached in the CCR workflow must have the Change Review Board (CRB) step completed and approved in Teamcenter.

4. **Corrective Action and Analysis**:
   - The corrective action section in the Product Deviation should document the ECR number and IRW Action Plan that will be used to update documents with a corrective action due date to Production Released within 3 months.
   - A teardown analysis is recommended to compare before and after conditions for the specific change, and the number of parts to be analyzed is at the discretion of the Plant Quality Manager.
   - Functional part performance and/or processing data must be reviewed to identify possible unexpected variations.

5. **Approval and Implementation**:
   - The responsibility of the Plant Quality Manager is to ensure that all steps are followed.
   - The Launch Leader is responsible for approving the PTR. If there is no Launch Leader for the change, the Plant Quality Manager assumes this responsibility.

These steps ensure that part revision changes are properly managed, documented, and approved, maintaining quality and compliance with customer requirements."

A manual car transmission, also known as a manual gearbox or stick shift, is a type of transmission used in motor vehicles that requires the driver to manually shift gears using a clutch and a gear stick. Here are some key points about manual transmissions:

### Components:
1. **Clutch Pedal**: This pedal is used to engage and disengage the engine from the transmission. Pressing the clutch pedal allows the driver to change gears.
2. **Gear Stick (Shifter)**: This is used to manually select the desired gear. It is typically located on the center console or on the steering column.
3. **Clutch Plate and Flywheel**: These components connect the engine to the transmission. The clutch plate engages with the flywheel to transfer power from the engine to the transmission.
4. **Synchronizers**: These help match the speed of the gears being engaged, allowing for smoother shifting.

### Operation:
1. **Starting the Car**: The driver presses the clutch pedal to disengage the engine from the transmission, then starts the engine.
2. **Shifting Gears**: To change gears, the driver presses the clutch pedal, moves the gear stick to the desired gear, and then releases the clutch pedal gradually while applying throttle.
3. **Driving**: The driver must manually shift through the gears as the vehicle accelerates and decelerates, matching the engine speed to the vehicle speed.

### Advantages:
1. **Control**: Manual transmissions provide greater control over the vehicle's power and speed, allowing for more precise driving.
2. **Fuel Efficiency**: They can be more fuel-efficient than automatic transmissions, especially in skilled hands.
3. **Simplicity**: Manual transmissions are mechanically simpler and often more durable than automatic transmissions.

### Disadvantages:
1. **Learning Curve**: They require more skill and practice to operate smoothly, which can be challenging for new drivers.
2. **Convenience**: In heavy traffic, constantly shifting gears can be tiring and less convenient compared to automatic transmissions.
3. **Market Availability**: Fewer new vehicles are being offered with manual transmissions, as automatic transmissions have become more popular.

### Common Terms:
- **Downshifting**: Shifting to a lower gear, often to increase engine braking or to accelerate more quickly.
- **Rev-Matching**: A technique used to match the engine speed to the transmission speed when downshifting, resulting in smoother gear changes.
- **Double Clutching**: A method used in older vehicles without synchronizers, where the driver engages the clutch twice to match gear speeds.

### Maintenance:
Manual transmissions generally require less maintenance than automatic transmissions, but they do need regular checks of the clutch system and transmission fluid.

If you have any specific questions about manual transmissions or need more detailed information, feel free to ask!"

This process involves training the model on a specialized dataset and configuring it to prioritize that data when generating responses. Here are a few ways this can be achieved:

1. **Domain-Specific Training**: The model can be trained exclusively on a dataset that contains only the relevant domain-specific information, such as eQMS data. This would limit the model's knowledge and responses to that specific domain.

2. **Response Filtering**: Implementing a filtering mechanism that checks the content of the response to ensure it aligns with the domain-specific data. If the response includes information outside the specified domain, it can be flagged or modified.

3. **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully crafting the prompts and instructions given to the model to ensure it focuses on the desired domain. This can include explicitly instructing the model to only use certain types of information.

4. **Access Control**: Restricting the model's access to only the domain-specific data during inference, ensuring that it cannot draw on the broader knowledge base.

5. **Post-Processing**: Adding a layer of post-processing that reviews and adjusts the model's output to ensure it adheres to the domain-specific constraints.

These methods can help ensure that the model provides responses that are strictly within the scope of the desired domain, such as eQMS data for Nexteer Automotive.

If you have any specific requirements or need further assistance, please let me know!"

Currently, I can provide responses that combine information from Nexteer Automotive's eQMS data with my broader pre-trained knowledge base. This allows me to offer comprehensive answers that leverage both domain-specific information and general knowledge.

For example, if you ask a question that involves specific eQMS data but also requires general automotive knowledge, I can integrate both sources to provide a more complete and informative response.

If you have any specific questions or need information that combines both eQMS data and general knowledge, feel free to ask!"

Here are some observations and conclusions:

### Observations:
1. **Frequent Issues with Ford REPS**:
   - A significant number of the reported issues are related to Ford's Rack Electric Power Steering (REPS) systems.
   - Common problems include cracked pulleys, internal failures, and incorrect setups.

2. **Recurring Problem Types**:
   - Many of the issues involve physical defects such as cracked pulleys and surface irregularities.
   - There are also several instances of incorrect setups or configurations, such as incorrect press force settings.

3. **Internal and Informal Complaints**:
   - The majority of the complaints are categorized as ""0Km Informal"" or ""Internal/General,"" indicating that these issues are often detected internally or at the early stages of the product lifecycle.

### Potential Common Root Causes:
1. **Manufacturing Process Issues**:
   - The recurrence of physical defects like cracked pulleys suggests potential issues in the manufacturing process, such as material quality, machining accuracy, or assembly procedures.
   - Incorrect setups and configurations point to possible gaps in process control and standard operating procedures.

2. **Quality Control and Inspection**:
   - The presence of surface irregularities and internal failures detected at the end of the line indicates that quality control and inspection processes may need to be strengthened.
   - Ensuring that all components meet the required specifications before assembly could help reduce these issues.

3. **Training and Standardization**:
   - Incorrect setups and configurations may be due to insufficient training or lack of adherence to standardized work instructions.
   - Implementing more rigorous training programs and ensuring that all operators follow standardized procedures could help mitigate these problems.

### Recommendations:
1. **Enhance Process Control**:
   - Review and improve the manufacturing processes to ensure that all components meet the required quality standards.
   - Implement stricter process controls and regular audits to identify and address potential issues early.

2. **Strengthen Quality Control**:
   - Enhance the quality control and inspection processes to catch defects before they progress through the assembly line.
   - Use advanced inspection techniques and tools to detect and address issues like surface irregularities and internal failures.

3. **Improve Training and Standardization**:
   - Develop comprehensive training programs for all operators to ensure they are well-versed in the correct procedures and setups.

1. **Ingresos Operativos (OI%) y Valor Presente Neto (NPV)**: Estos son nuestros principales entregables financieros. El éxito requiere un esfuerzo de equipo completo, integridad y responsabilidad desde el inicio hasta el final [functions.search_knowledgebase_tool].

2. **Gestión del Squeeze Positivo**: Un **Squeeze Positivo** ocurre cuando obtenemos más reducciones de costos de los proveedores de las que damos en reducciones de precios a los clientes. Esto implica:
   - Las reducciones de precios a los clientes deben ser compensadas por reducciones en el costo de los materiales.
   - La productividad en costos de manufactura y estructurales ayuda a compensar la inflación y mejorar nuestras ganancias, pero no debe dependerse de ella para compensar las reducciones de precios a los clientes.
   - Asegurar que haya reducciones de materiales compensatorias para todas las reducciones de precios contratadas [functions.search_knowledgebase_tool].

3. **Plan de Mejora de Costos de Materiales (MCIP)**: Es un contribuyente clave para lograr un Squeeze Positivo. Esto incluye:
   - **Doble Sourcing**: Tener más de un proveedor aprobado para suministrar una parte o material.
   - **Sistemas y Procedimientos de Calidad del Proveedor**: Establecer estándares y consistencia para Nexteer en nuestros proveedores a nivel global [functions.search_knowledgebase_tool].

1. **Operating Income (OI%) and Net Present Value (NPV)**: These are our primary financial deliverables. Success requires a full team effort, integrity, and accountability from start to finish [functions.search_knowledgebase_tool].

2. **Managing Positive Squeeze**: A **Positive Squeeze** occurs when we achieve more cost reductions from suppliers than we give in price reductions to customers. This involves:
   - Ensuring that price reductions to customers are offset by material cost reductions.
   - Manufacturing and structural cost productivity helps offset inflation and improve our earnings but should not be relied upon to offset customer price reductions.
   - Ensuring there are compensatory material reductions for all contracted price reductions [functions.search_knowledgebase_tool].

3. **Material Cost Improvement Plan (MCIP)**: This is a key contributor to achieving a Positive Squeeze. This includes:
   - **Dual Sourcing**: Having more than one approved supplier to provide a part or material.
   - **Supplier Quality Systems and Procedures**: Establishing standards and consistency for Nexteer in our suppliers globally [functions.search_knowledgebase_tool].

4. **Quality of Bookings**: When seeking new business, we must ensure the financial health, risk management, and profitability of each opportunity. The **Quality of Bookings** measures the financial robustness when securing a new business win [functions.search_knowledgebase_tool].

5. **Customer Program Implementation (CPI)**: This is Nexteer's process for planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing activities and risks associated with launching a program from the project letter through the customer's start of production, plus an additional six months of continuous improvement activities before handing the program over to manufacturing [functions.search_knowledgebase_tool].

- **Total Price with Commodities**: The total price quoted to customers often includes additional costs such as packaging, freight, import/export duties, and other value-added services. Material escalations and market fluctuations are also considered, and adjustments are made accordingly.

In conclusion, Nexteer Automotive quotes customers with a total price that includes the base price plus any additional costs related to commodities, transportation, and other value-added services. This ensures that all relevant costs are accounted for in the final quotation provided to the customer."

The Material Escalation Procedure at Nexteer Automotive is designed to manage and negotiate material price changes due to fluctuations in commodity markets. Here are the detailed steps involved in executing this procedure:

#### 1. Objective and Scope
- **Objective**: Provide guidance to buyers for negotiating material escalations and exercising material escalation agreements to mitigate financial exposure to commodity price fluctuations.
- **Scope**: Applies globally to new material escalation agreements negotiated and issued after October 1, 2023. Existing agreements may remain unchanged but must comply with this instruction for new parts.

#### 2. Escalation Negotiation
- **Customer Material Escalation Information**: Populate within Intelex according to the CPI Program by the GSM Pursuit or Launch Leader.
- **Negotiation Items**: Include market index, frequency of adjustment, part weight, and escalation rate calculation period.
- **Documentation**: Use the GSM standard material escalation agreement template located in Intelex.

#### 3. Documenting the Escalation Agreement
- **Contract Template**: The Nexteer standard material escalation contract template is housed in Intelex.
- **Process**:
  - Click on the contract to obtain a new number.
  - Document all items and send the contract to the Supplier for signature.
  - The Buyer signs and uploads a copy of the contract into Intelex along with any other documents such as approved deviations.

#### 4. Exercising the Escalation Agreement
- **Proactive Engagement**: The Buyer should work with the Supplier at the established frequency to exercise the escalation agreement.
- **Calculation Files**: Maintain calculation files outside of Intelex to support price movement or no price movement for each period according to the contract.
- **Intelex Alerts**: Intelex will alert the buyer when it is time to calculate material escalation based on the agreed adjustment frequency and period.
- **Market Index Validation**: The Buyer validates commodity index prices and determines if purchase order pricing movement is necessary per the agreement.
- **Currency Conversion**: If the market index is in a different currency than the purchase order, convert to PO currency using rates provided by Nexteer Treasury.

#### 5. Unique Commodities
- **Steel**: Steel is unique due to its composition from scrap steel, which may vary in price based on the type and amount of scrap and alloy in each heat.
- **Part Weight**: The GSM Launch Leader provides the Buyer with material weights based on raw material content. Net weight is the standard for negotiating de/escalation coverage.

#### 6. Frequency of Escalation/Adjustment
- **Standard Frequency**: Quarterly adjustments are standard unless otherwise specified in the customer contract.
- **Approval for Non-Standard Frequency**: Any adjustments sooner than quarterly must be substantiated by the Buyer and approved by the GSM Regional Director.

#### 7. Escalation Rate Calculation Period
- **Defined Periods**: Common examples include the previous 3 months average, the first 15 days average of the previous month, or the end of month rate.
- **Example**: A quarterly adjustment escalation contract may use the previous 3 months average index for rate calculation.

#### 8. Reference Documentation
- **Approval Requirements Direct Material and Services (5.1.4.403)**
- **Price Change Instruction (5.1.4.414)**
- **Nomination Letter Instruction (5.1.5.i403)**

### Summary
The Material Escalation Procedure at Nexteer Automotive involves a structured approach to negotiating and managing material price changes due to market fluctuations. It includes documenting agreements, proactive engagement with suppliers, maintaining calculation files, validating market indices, and adhering to defined escalation frequencies and calculation periods.

However, the specific meaning of colors like orange and white can vary depending on the organization's internal standards and the specific context in which they are used.

Here is a general interpretation that might apply:

### Orange State:
- **Warning or Attention Needed**: Orange typically indicates that there is a potential issue or a situation that requires attention. It may not be critical yet, but it is a signal that something is not performing as expected and needs to be monitored or addressed to prevent it from escalating into a more serious problem.
- **Intermediate Risk**: It can also represent an intermediate level of risk or concern, suggesting that while the situation is not critical, it is not optimal and should be improved.

### White State:
- **Normal or No Issues**: White usually signifies that everything is operating normally and there are no significant issues or concerns. It indicates a stable and acceptable condition.
- **Baseline or Standard**: It can also represent a baseline or standard state, meaning that the process or condition is as expected and within acceptable limits.

To provide a more accurate and specific answer, it would be helpful to refer to the particular guidelines or documentation used by Nexteer Automotive or the specific CPI framework in question. If you have access to such documentation or if there are specific contexts or examples you can provide, I can offer a more tailored explanation."

   - **Lesson Learned Problem Description**: See Whoosh Return # 2 CA # 107681. [10:32 AM] Mark Duthie. Hello Good Morning Chris, Thank you for the opportunity to come to the Factory Zero facility yesterday to investigate this steering noise concern. From Nexteer, Mark Duthie, Matt Pretzer and Neil Rumschlag were present. Below is a summary of our activity yesterday, 10/27/2022. We started by evaluating the steering noise with windows up, HVAC off. When steering the vehicle statically (no rolling motion) at all steering wheel RPM, a scuffing noise was audible most noticeably in the CW direction. It was observed visually that the I-shaft had lateral motion when changing directions as well as some eccentric motion. A plastic bushing/bearing in the FOD seal was suspected to possibly contribute to the noise and it was removed to re-evaluate the noise. Re-evaluation confirmed the noise still present, again noticeably in the CW direction, no change from removal of the seal and bushing/bearing. Next, we probed, using a mechanical stethoscope, various points on the steering gear while another engineer steered the vehicle in both directions. The noise characteristics were most noticeable on the pinion tower housing as well as the tie-rod/rack bar. Subjectively, the noise directional behavior and content was observed while probing the steering gear. To record objective data, a tri-axial accelerometer was glued to the pinion tower casting. Using a field data recorder, several steering cycles were performed while measuring binaural audible noise in the driver`s seat along with the three channels of acceleration. See Whoosh Return # 2 CA # 107681. 2nd Intelex Problem Case issued to C&U Bearing is # 35199.

   - **Lesson Learned Problem Description**: See Whoosh Return # 2 CA # 107681. [10:32 AM] Mark Duthie. Hello Good Morning Chris, Thank you for the opportunity to come to the Factory Zero facility yesterday to investigate this steering noise concern. From Nexteer, Mark Duthie, Matt Pretzer and Neil Rumschlag were present. Below is a summary of our activity yesterday, 10/27/2022. We started by evaluating the steering noise with windows up, HVAC off. When steering the vehicle statically (no rolling motion) at all steering wheel RPM, a scuffing noise was audible most noticeably in the CW direction. It was observed visually that the I-shaft had lateral motion when changing directions as well as some eccentric motion. A plastic bushing/bearing in the FOD seal was suspected to possibly contribute to the noise and it was removed to re-evaluate the noise. Re-evaluation confirmed the noise still present, again noticeably in the CW direction, no change from removal of the seal and bushing/bearing. Next, we probed, using a mechanical stethoscope, various points on the steering gear while another engineer steered the vehicle in both directions. The noise characteristics were most noticeable on the pinion tower housing as well as the tie-rod/rack bar. Subjectively, the noise directional behavior and content was observed while probing the steering gear. To record objective data, a tri-axial accelerometer was glued to the pinion tower casting. Using a field data recorder, several steering cycles were performed while measuring binaural audible noise in the driver`s seat along with the three channels of acceleration. See Whoosh Return # 2 CA # 107681. 2nd Intelex Problem Case issued to C&U Bearing is # 35199.
   - **Specific/Systemic Cause**: DIM/FUNCT_Bill of Design
   - **Containment Actions**: Add Noise Test Cepstrum Analysis Tool to detect BT Gears with Whoosh Noise Signature (Automated Test implemented 8/9/23).

The 5 Why technique involves asking ""Why?"" five times to drill down to the root cause of the problem. Here’s how you can frame your initial question and subsequent questions:

### Initial Problem Statement:
- **Problem Statement**: ""Why is there a noise issue in the [specific part or system]?""

### Example 5 Why Analysis for Noise Issue:
1. **Why is there a noise issue in the [specific part or system]?**
   - Possible Answer: Because the [specific part] is vibrating excessively.

2. **Why is the [specific part] vibrating excessively?**
   - Possible Answer: Because the [specific part] is not properly secured.

3. **Why is the [specific part] not properly secured?**
   - Possible Answer: Because the mounting bolts are loose.

4. **Why are the mounting bolts loose?**
   - Possible Answer: Because the bolts were not torqued to the correct specification during assembly.

5. **Why were the bolts not torqued to the correct specification during assembly?**
   - Possible Answer: Because the torque wrench used was not calibrated correctly.

### Final Root Cause:
- The torque wrench used during assembly was not calibrated correctly, leading to loose mounting bolts and excessive vibration, which caused the noise issue.

### Steps to Create Your 5 Why Analysis:
1. **Identify the Problem**: Clearly define the noise issue you are investigating.
2. **Ask the First Why**: Start with the initial problem statement and ask why it is happening.
3. **Ask Subsequent Whys**: For each answer, ask why that condition exists.
4. **Continue Until Root Cause**: Repeat the process until you reach the root cause, typically after five iterations.
5. **Document Findings**: Record each question and answer to create a comprehensive 5 Why analysis.

### Example Questions for Your Case:
1. Why is there a noise issue in the [specific part or system]?
2. Why is the [specific part] vibrating excessively?
3. Why is the [specific part] not properly secured?
4. Why are the mounting bolts loose?
5. Why were the bolts not torqued to the correct specification during assembly?

By following this structured approach, you can systematically identify the root cause of the noise issue and take appropriate corrective actions."
