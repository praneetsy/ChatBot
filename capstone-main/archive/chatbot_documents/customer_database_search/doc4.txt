Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
Title: Understanding Customer Lifetime Value

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a crucial metric that estimates the total revenue a business can expect from a customer over the duration of their relationship. This document explains the significance of CLV and how to calculate it.

To calculate CLV, businesses must consider factors such as average purchase value, purchase frequency, and customer lifespan. For example, if a customer spends $100 per transaction, shops four times a year, and remains a customer for five years, their CLV would be $2,000.

Understanding CLV helps businesses make informed decisions regarding customer acquisition and retention strategies. A high CLV indicates that investing in customer retention initiatives can yield significant returns.

By regularly monitoring CLV, businesses can identify trends and adjust their strategies accordingly. Increasing CLV can involve enhancing customer experience, offering loyalty programs, and personalizing communications.
